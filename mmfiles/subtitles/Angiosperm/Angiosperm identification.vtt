00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.280
Just a bit earlier in the series, we introduced
the angiosperms, which are the flowering plants.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.949
This is an incredibly diverse clade that includes
everything from asparagus to apples, from

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:26.600
clovers to cacti, from oil palms to potatoes,
from maize to mistletoe, and many others.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.210
So now it’s time to dive into that diversity
so we can further classify them.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.940
Angiosperm evolution is complicated, and it’s
possible that our current classification may

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.640
be rewritten someday.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.710
However, current cladistical modeling indicates
that they can be broadly separated into “basal”

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.460
and “core” groups.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.899
The basal angiosperm clade is paraphyletic,
meaning that it includes the most recent common

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.760
ancestor of all the organisms, but does not
contain all of the descendants of that common

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.399
ancestor, as opposed to being monophyletic,
which would mean that it does contain all

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.500
the descendants of the most recent common
ancestor.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.930
The basal clade contains only about 175 species
that diverged early on in angiosperm evolution.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.060
The basal angiosperms include the Amborellales,
a monophyletic order of small shrubs, the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.010
Nymphaeales, an order of aquatic plants, such
as the water lilies, and the Austrobaileyales,

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.600
an order of woody trees, shrubs, and vines
such as star anise.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.939
The core angiosperm clade, also known as the
mesangiospermae is monophyletic and includes

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.540
over 99.9% of all flowering plants.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.350
They are further divided into five clades,
the ceratophyllales, chloranthales, magnoliidae,

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.229
monocots, and eudicots.

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:10.149
The clade ceratophyllaceae is a cosmopolitan
family, meaning it is found all over the world,

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:17.260
and it includes a single extant genus of aquatic
flowering plants commonly known as hornworts,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.019
where extant means still in existence today.

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:27.159
The clade chloranthaceae is a family of woody
plants found in many tropical regions around

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.579
the world and often used in traditional medicines.

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.189
Now, it might seem like I’ve already covered
a lot of angiosperm diversity.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:40.819
However, the five clades I’ve just mentioned,
though evolutionarily distinct, account for

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.090
only about 0.1% of known angiosperms.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.829
The clade magnoliidae makes up another 2%
of all known flowering plants.

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.900
This group of plants includes species that
are economically important for food, drugs,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.859
perfume, and timber.

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:05.949
They include some more widely cultivated tropical
species like the avocado, black pepper, cinnamon,

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.699
and soursop.

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:13.469
They also include the ornamental magnolia
trees, the laurels, and others.

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:19.919
So that leaves us with just two clades left
to cover, the monocots and the eudicots.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:26.379
These two clades make up almost 98% of all
flowering plants and are the two groups most

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.249
commonly discussed in angiosperm classification.

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:37.459
Their names refer to the first embryonic leaves,
or seed leaves, that appear on the plant embryo.

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.139
These are also called cotyledons.

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:48.579
A monocot embryo has a single cotyledon while
a eudicot has two cotyledons.

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:56.989
The monocots account for about 60,000 species,
which make up roughly 23% of all named angiosperms.

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.079
The largest family of monocots, by far, are
the orchids, which account for about 20,000

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.559
to 28,000 accepted species.

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:12.389
Orchids alone represent about 6-11% of all
seed-producing plants.

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:17.620
Though orchids are often thought of as tropical
species, and it is true that their diversity

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.460
is greatest in the tropics, they’re actually
found on every continent except Antarctica.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.229
Other major groups of monocots include the
bamboos, palms, lilies, and grasses.

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.409
The majority of the biomass produced in agriculture
comes from the monocots.

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:44.069
This is because all major grains, like rice,
wheat, maize, barley, millet, and oats are

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.069
monocots.

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:52.050
The same goes for all forage grasses, which
are used as feed for cattle, along with sugarcane,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.850
bananas, gingers, pineapples, leeks, onions,
and garlic.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.750
In addition, many bulb plants cultivated for
their blooms, like bluebells and tulips, are

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.570
all monocots.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.500
Moving on, traditionally the angiosperms had
been separated into two groups, the monocots

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.039
and the dicots.

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:18.320
This is because monocots have many distinctive
features that separate them from dicots.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.540
For example, monocot leaves usually have parallel
veins, while dicot veins are usually branched.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.590
Monocot stems have vascular tissues arranged
in a complex array of tiny bundles throughout

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.210
the stem, while dicot stems have their vascular
bundles arranged in a ring.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.730
The petals of monocot flowers are generally
arranged in multiples of three, while dicot

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.349
flowers are generally in multiples of fours
or fives.

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:53.509
Finally, the roots of monocots form a fibrous
system, like a mat of threads that spread

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:55.240
out below the soil surface.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.129
Dicot roots, however, have a large vertical
taproot that burrows deeper into the soil.

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.990
However, this simplified two group system
has since been abandoned.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.449
Although all of those characteristics are
still unique to the monocots, the old classification

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:17.419
of “dicot” has since been split up into
the basal angiosperms and magnoliidae that

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.639
were mentioned earlier, and the eudicots or
“true” dicots.

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.340
The eudicots make up about 75% of all flowering
plants.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.490
They are all evolutionarily related and distinguished
from all other flowering plants by the grooved

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.719
tricolpate structure of their pollen.

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:43.050
All other angiosperm groups produce monosulcate
pollen, with a single pore set in a groove

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.210
of a different orientation.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.960
Some botanists prefer to call the eudicots
“tricolpates” in order to avoid confusion

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.370
with the old dicot classification.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:59.430
However, since they’re more commonly referred
to as eudicots, we can stick to that here.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.849
The eudicots include most shrubs and leafy
trees, along with the carnivorous plants,

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:12.319
many ornamental flowers, and a huge range
of food crops including most fruits, vegetables,

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.509
and nuts.

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:23.819
Apples, coffee, pumpkins, celery, cannabis,
nightshade, oaks, maples, corpse flowers,

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:34.570
eucalyptus, aspen, dandelions, oranges, buttercups,
morning glories, cacti, cherries, cranberries,

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:40.460
carnations, and so many other plants are all
classified as eudicots.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:46.199
This clade includes a truly staggering amount
of species that have adapted to unique habitats

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:51.270
all over the world, from the hottest deserts,
to some of the coldest tundras, and everywhere

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.360
in between.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.979
Perhaps we will take a closer look at some
of these species a bit later in the series.

00:07:56.979 --> 00:08:02.520
But for now, that completes an introduction
to a general classification of the most diverse

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:32.969
extant group of plants, the angiosperms.
