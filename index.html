                        Mosses are small flowerless plants that do not have a true vascular
                        system and therefore are unable to draw water and nutrients up from
                        the ground over a distance, which is why they are unable to grow
                        very large. This feature distinguishes them from Ferns and flowering
                        plants. Instead of roots, mosses have rhizoids – fine brown laments,
                        resembling roots that anchor them to the ground but do not draw up
                        water. They also absorb water and nutrients mainly through their
                        leaves, which are usually only a single cell in thickness also, they
                        do not have flowers or fruit and instead of seeds, they have spores.
                        They belong to a diverse group of organisms called Bryophytes and
                        are among the simplest of terrestrial plants and are among the
                        earliest plants to become adapted to living on dry land, having
                        evolved from algae. There are an estimated 12,000 species of Moss
                        that are classified as Bryophytes, which are among the group of
                        plants that reproduce by spores it also plays an important role in
                        regulating ecosystems because they provide a vital buffer system for
                        plants that live close by and benefit from the water and nutrients
                        that mosses collect. Lastly, mosses play an important role in our
                        ecosystems, as they are crucial for soil stabilization and water
                        retention, helping in the prevention of floods and landslides.

                        Ferns are “vascular” plants that are, having an efficient internal
                        conducting system of vessels that transports water and salts upwards
                        and food downwards and so they tend to grow quite large, unlike
                        mosses that are what are called “non-vascular” plants that is, they
                        do not have water-conducting roots or vessels and so tend to be very
                        tiny plants. They also belong to the family technically known as
                        Pteridophytes and are among the estimated 10,560 species of plants
                        that reproduce by spores producing neither seeds nor flowers and can
                        be dated back some 360 million years to the Carboniferous period and
                        formed the forests that later fossilized into coal. Many ferns from
                        tropical rainforests are Epiphytes their water comes from the damp
                        air, water-soaked terrain, and host plant, and from rainfall running
                        down branches and tree trunks also, there are also some purely
                        aquatic ferns such as the Water fern or Water velvet and Mosquito
                        ferns. It also does not produce seeds or flowers but reproduces via
                        spores, their reproductive system consists of two distinct
                        consecutive generations the normal plant produces non-sexual
                        reproductive bodies called “spores”. They can help fight soil
                        erosions since their complex root system helps maintain soil
                        stability. They are very popular in Asia where the Azolla fern is
                        used as a natural fertilizer for rice crops they are also used
                        homoeopathically for treating ailments ranging from expelling
                        parasites to treating bowel disorders, coughs, and lung problems
                        since ingesting some ferns can also cause you to be quite ill these
                        are remedies best left to the professionals.

                        Gymnosperms are seed plants adapted to live on land they are
                        autotrophic, photosynthetic organisms that tend to conserve water.
                        They have a vascular system (used for the transportation of water
                        and nutrients) that includes roots, xylem, and phloem. The name
                        gymnosperm means “naked seed,” this term comes from the fact that
                        the ovules and seeds of gymnosperms develop on the scales of cones
                        rather than in enclosed chambers called ovaries. They are
                        sporophytes (a plant with two copies of its genetic material,
                        capable of producing spores). Their sporangia (receptacle in which
                        sexual spores are formed) are found on plated scale-like structures
                        that together make up cones. The female gametophyte develops from
                        the haploid (meaning one set of genetic material) spores that are
                        contained within the sporangia. They are heterosporous meaning both
                        sexes of gametophytes develop from different types of spores
                        produced by separate cones. One type of cone is the small pollen
                        cone, which produces microspores that subsequently develop into
                        pollen grains. The other type of cones, the larger “ovulate” cones,
                        make megaspores that develop into female gametophytes called ovules.
                        Incredibly, this whole sexual process can take three years. Fossil
                        records indicate the first gymnosperms (progymnosperms) most likely
                        originated in the Paleozoic era, during the middle Devonian period
                        about 390 million years ago.

                        Angiosperms have flowers at some stage in their life. The flowers
                        are the reproductive organs for the plant, providing them with a
                        means of exchanging genetic information. Their sporophyte is
                        differentiated into stems, roots, and leaves. and their vascular
                        system has true vessels in the xylem and companion cells in the
                        phloem. Their ovules are enclosed in the ovary at the base of the
                        megasporophyll. They are heterosporous, meaning they produce two
                        kinds of spores, microspores (pollen grains) and megaspores also
                        single functional megaspore is permanently retained within the
                        nucellus. Their pollen grains transfer from the anther to stigma and
                        reproduction takes place by pollination. They are responsible for
                        the transfer of genetic information from one flower to the other.
                        Their root system is very complex and consists of the cortex, xylem,
                        phloem, and epidermis also they can survive in a variety of
                        habitats, including marine habitats. The process of fertilization is
                        quicker in angiosperms, the seeds are also produced quickly due to
                        the smaller female reproductive parts. Also, all angiosperms are
                        comprised of stamens which are the reproductive structures of the
                        flowers. They produce the pollen grains that carry the hereditary
                        information and their production of the endosperm is one of the
                        greatest advantages of angiosperms. The endosperm is formed after
                        fertilization and is a source of food for the developing seed and
                        seedling. Lastly, angiosperm originated about 250 million years ago
                        and comprises 80% of the earth’s plant life. They are also a major
                        source of food for humans and animals.
