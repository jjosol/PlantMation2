00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
Cave run and welcome back in this video

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.750
discuss the basics on how to obtain Moss

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.030
from local sources and how to propagate

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.120
it for prolonged abuse in terrariums and

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.099
pavilions this is the general care guide

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.470
that outlines techniques suitable for

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.330
various types of Moss these are the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.310
techniques that I personally use and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.949
have found to be extremely effective as

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.220
you well now I almost always use moss

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.420
and my terrarium and pavilion builds

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.160
propagating your on Moss is extremely

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.929
easy to do and it's very useful

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.180
especially if you create as many

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.160
projects as I do even if you don't

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.040
create very frequently it's still wise

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.040
to propagate your own Moss this remain

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.870
benefits include convenience safety and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.960
success did you know that there are over

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.070
10,000 species of moss it's true and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.500
although they are found in base

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.840
conditions most can acclimate quite well

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.449
and thrive in very moist environments

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.430
luckily for us that's exactly the type

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.489
of environment found in a terrarium or

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.350
vivarium that said when propagating Moss

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.810
one of the most important factors to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.090
consider is moisture Moz will grow very

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.070
quick and dense one provided enough

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.049
water however if you don't provide

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.750
enough it will quickly dry out and in

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.439
many cases die for good if you can get

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.619
this down

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.909
you will become a green thumb in no time

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.950
before we can do anything though we need

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.810
to get some moss you can find moss

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.150
pretty much anywhere you can order it

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.530
online gather from the forest find it in

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.810
your yard or you can pick it from the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.670
cracks of the sidewalk I'm an

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.470
opportunist a gatherer and have been

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.869
known to grab a patch of moss wherever

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.460
and whenever I see it just keep your

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.500
eyes peeled and you'll notice it just

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.329
about anywhere today I'm gathering

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.399
various types of moss from the woods

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.320
behind my house I've extensively

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.200
explored these woods so I know exactly

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.030
where certain types of moss grow one

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.610
harvest thing I never completely removed

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.009
any patches mom I do this so that I can

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.750
continually return to the same spots and

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.090
of course that I don't deplete the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.060
resources completely think of it as

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.530
sustainable harvesting a good way to do

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.689
this is to grab some moss from the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.940
middle of a patch and then fluff the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.039
moss over the void that was just created

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.959
it's like nothing was ever removed

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.049
or simply take a little bit from the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.049
edges like so there's moss everywhere so

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.519
no need to be greedy with a single patch

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.260
now that we have some moss we can take

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.959
it home and get it prepared to the next

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.700
step first and foremost we're going to

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.610
need a container and some form of

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.920
purified water generally I use tap water

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.230
treated with drops like these rep tight

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.200
safe drops you could also use reverse

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.709
osmosis water spring water distilled

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.849
water or rainwater to name a few

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.879
fill up your container with a decent

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.980
amount of water then submerge your moss

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.079
and let it soak the reason that we are

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.440
doing this is to remove any debris and

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.150
as many hitchhikers as we possibly can

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.319
soaking the moss will also rehydrate it

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.319
if it's little on the dry side

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.459
anyway set this container aside and let

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.250
the moss soak while we do the next few

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.680
steps so the next part we need a tight

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.870
seal in container anything that will

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.359
hold humidity and has a transparent lid

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.280
will work fine I used to use aquariums

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.410
with the plastic lid but I fished a

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.000
Tupperware containers for convenience I

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.549
got this twenty quart Tupperware

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.079
container for about six dollars so the

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.699
cost is really cheap and you could

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.280
always reuse it for something else later

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:31.290
on now that we have a suitable container

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.150
we can move on to our drainage layer

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.910
which I usually refer to as a false

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.799
bottom here I simply have some gravel

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.560
but you can use various materials to

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.329
make your false bottom regardless of

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.310
what you use you don't need very much of

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.349
it this layer will mostly help

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.180
perpetuate the water cycle but it will

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.090
also keep the substrate from getting too

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.859
soggy from exposure to water about a

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.160
half an inch of your drainage element

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:59.259
should be sufficient

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.259
[Music]

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.140
afterward we need something to keep the

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.630
substrate separate from the false bottom

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.190
add some carbon fiber glass window

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.140
screen which is what I typically use

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.700
there are a lot of materials that you

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.410
could use for this part and here's a

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.630
little list that I compiled for you

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.630
regardless of what you use as a mesh

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.940
barrier we have to cut it to size as I

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.230
stated in past videos when you cut mesh

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.060
for your projects you should cut it

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.250
slightly larger than the size of the

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.010
bottom of your container I'll show you

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.200
why in just a second also I like to cut

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:38.060
my mesh using an exacto knife you could

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.220
use scissors as well once your mesh is

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.920
cut simply place it in your container so

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.780
that the excess goes up the sides this

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.120
will prevent any substrate from sneaking

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:52.820
down in between the mesh and the side of

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:55.250
the container now we have to add a

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.110
purification element this will help keep

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.480
the water as clean as possible when it

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.460
passes down into the false bottom it

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.470
also helps prevent mold buildup which is

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.930
always a possibility in an enclosed

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.850
environment like this your best option

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.040
you see that activated carbon or

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.630
landfill charcoal I suggest using

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.700
non-food charcoal because it's really

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.530
cheap by volume if you only need a

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.350
little bit than activated carbon might

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.870
be your best bet put in a thick layer of

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.880
your purification element this enclosure

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.410
will main very moist at all times

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.420
so we need to ensure that the

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.860
environment is as fresh as possible and

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.860
this layer will do exactly that

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:36.889
next we can add the substrate layer I

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:39.259
prefer to use my typical tropical

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.719
substrate mix because it remains fluffy

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.999
even in very moist conditions follow the

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.439
link to learn more about it however it

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.479
doesn't matter what type of substrate

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:49.669
you use generic potting soil like this

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.519
or even dirt from outside will work as

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.099
well if you start from outside I highly

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:57.649
recommend sterilizing it before use you

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:59.259
can do so by baking at 350 degrees for

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:01.489
about 15 minutes in the oven

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.909
additionally if your intent is to use

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:06.429
these mosses for variable house animals

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:08.749
definitely do not use dirt from outside

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:10.909
anyways put it in when your substrate

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:13.039
into your container it doesn't need to

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:16.209
be very thick since most mosses simply

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.209
grow on top of the substrate

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.850
[Music]

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.010
once your substrate is in place lightly

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.720
mist it to even off the surface and to

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:31.510
keep it from sticking to the moss later

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:33.610
on now we can return to our moss as you

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.770
can see the water is extremely murky and

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.870
has a lot of particles floating around I

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.750
doubt that yours will get this dirty as

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.740
most of it came from the sphagnum moss

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.360
regardless this should illustrate why

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.290
it's a good idea to clean the moss in

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.630
the first place

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.520
now get another container full of clean

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.010
water and transfer the moss into this

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.050
one if you notice any debris as you

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.240
transfer the moss be sure to remove what

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.310
you can keep repeating this process

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.810
until the water remains pretty clean

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.510
when you transfer the moss from

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.460
container to container as stated earlier

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.140
the whole point of this process is to

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.420
remove as much foreign materials as

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.340
possible even though this is pretty

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.290
effective at removing most pests

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.720
it doesn't effectively remove microbes

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.490
that said if your intent is these moths

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.060
obtained from outside and of the vein

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.990
with animals do so your own discretion

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.000
personally I've never had anything

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.520
adverse happen but the potential is

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.860
there in regards to this I thought it -

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.690
rules of thumb I always keep my mosses

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.750
for a few months before adding them to

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:33.430
set up intended for animals also I only

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.500
use moths from outside and newly

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.600
established tanks before adding the

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.910
animals rather than adding it later on

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.070
these steps won't guarantee that nothing

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.770
will happen but any precaution that can

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.780
be taken should also if you're simply

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.190
using your mods for a terrarium you

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.440
don't have to be concerned with anything

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.300
in fact you don't need to sterilize your

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.260
moss in the first place but it's never a

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.810
bad idea

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.030
once your Mons is good to go simply

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.380
place it in your container you don't

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.960
need to bury it in the substrate or

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.930
anything like that I prefer to keep my

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.730
mosses and patches based on the type you

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.980
can also break a larger piece of moss

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.490
into smaller sections to promote faster

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.490
growth

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:23.660
[Music]

00:08:24.339 --> 00:08:30.189
what's your mosses in place give your

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:30.189
container thorough misting

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:42.250
I should also mention that if you want

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.560
to add any sort of micro fauna such as

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.700
spring tales or isopods you can do so as

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.930
well now I will briefly go for lighting

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.730
Moss isn't very picky

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:58.810
it grows in bright light or in low light

00:08:51.730 --> 00:09:00.730
I've used various CFL bulbs a nine and a

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:05.560
half watt LED bulb which is equivalent

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:08.710
to 40 watts and this 15 watt t3 light

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:11.380
fixture however at this point I strictly

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:13.540
use LED bulbs they seem to work the best

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.820
are more efficient and create minimal

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.440
heat you can set your lights directly on

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.300
top of the container but I suggest

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.450
parking it slightly above the container

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:25.720
like so I have my lights on a 10 hour on

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:27.460
and 14 off light cycle any alteration to

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.800
the cycle shouldn't make much of a

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:32.140
difference last thing that we'll cover

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.820
is water after you initially water your

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.980
enclosure you should only have to water

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:38.220
the moss about once a month these

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.810
containers hold moisture extremely well

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.370
simply monitor the moss and if it looks

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.770
like you could be drying out add a

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.480
little bit of water the August time you

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.370
should have to spray a lot of water is

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.830
initially every other time after that

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.780
you can spray a little bit all the

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.460
muscles that you saw me use or temperate

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.990
however they acclimate to the

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.820
environment of the terrarium and

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.980
prevailing without dying back quite

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.900
nicely the only type that I don't have

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.060
the best luck with is pillar moss

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.280
it will do great initially and then kind

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.780
of die off I don't think that this type

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.410
of environment is suitable for a

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.410
long-term

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.950
anyways that about sums up this

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:18.260
demonstration as you can see this

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.670
process is really quite simple I hope

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.980
that you learned something useful from

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:24.400
this demonstration and as always thank

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.400
you for watching
