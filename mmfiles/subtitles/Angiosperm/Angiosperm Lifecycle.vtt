00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.120
in this video we are going to look at

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:10.920
the last type of plant that we're going

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.820
to study and that is the angiosperms so

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.990
we've looked at the mosses and we've

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.070
looked at the ferns which muscles are

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.720
the nonvascular plants ferns are the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.740
vascular plants but they're seedless and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.170
then we've looked at the gymnosperms

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.040
which are the vascular plants that use

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.980
seeds and the angiosperms are vascular

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.770
plants that use seeds but what separates

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.040
them from the gymnosperms is that they

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.480
use flowers and so here we've got lots

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.640
of nice pictures of different flowers so

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.739
the first thing we have to do is we have

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.850
to look at the actual structure of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.829
flowers and see how that is different

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.879
scheme there see what those parts are so

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.160
that we can discuss the lifecycle so

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.589
here's our flower and what we're gonna

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.979
do is we are going to explore the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.950
structure a little bit so if we want to

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.390
start at the bottom um at the very

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.390
bottom of the flower we have what's

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.600
called the receptacle and that is just

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.640
simply this area right here and that is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.320
where the flower actually attaches to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.720
the stem or the chute and it's just it's

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.340
usually kind of a thicker part of the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.979
stem at the end and it's essentially

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.470
just what the flower grows out of the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.450
next thing moving up is the sepals and

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.490
if you look on any flower these are just

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.500
going to be they almost look like little

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.079
green leaves but they're not really

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.820
leaves and they are going to be

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.970
underneath the flower when the when

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.329
flowers are budding the sepals are

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.049
actually what enclosed the flower so as

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:59.369
you can see in this picture right here

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.719
the newly forming flower the petals are

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.200
right here that's always the color part

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.530
but the sepals are actually this green

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.729
part that actually surround the budding

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.099
flower the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.840
think moving up from the sepals is

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.310
actually going to be what most people

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.209
think of when they think of flowers and

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.440
that's the petals so the petals are

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.220
actually the colored part of the flower

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.170
and their primary purpose is to attract

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.310
pollinators to be nice and bright and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.069
pretty in the springtime because unlike

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.819
gymnosperms gymnosperms we said disperse

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.430
their pollen by wind but angiosperms are

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.299
going to disperse their pollen mostly by

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:48.200
the organisms by insects moths and flies

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.510
and bees and hummingbirds that are going

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.910
to actually get in the flower to get

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.430
nectar which is a sweet sugary material

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.290
gonna get pollen on them and travel to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.280
the next flower as far as the actual

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.650
reproductive parts of the flower go

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.480
let's start by looking at the male

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.500
structures so we're going to be looking

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.200
at the male hope that's not the male

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.620
there you go the male structure of the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.819
flower and this is going to be what we

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:23.090
call the stamen and as you can see on

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.599
this picture there are three statements

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:30.079
on each side so there's three or excuse

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.500
me I guess actually I should draw there

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.450
we go

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.760
three stamen on each side four in this

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.650
picture a total of six and that's going

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.660
to be very important later when we talk

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:48.859
about the difference in monocots and

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:52.130
dicots or eudicots the stamen is made up

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:55.190
of two parts it's made up of the anther

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.549
which is the top part and that's what

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.650
actually produces the pollen so when the

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.819
pollinators get down inside the flower

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.500
they will be searching for that nectar

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.760
and they will get pollen from the anther

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.069
stuck on them and they'll carry it to

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.069
other flowers and then the part of the

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.340
flower that the anther actually sits on

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:19.070
is what we call the filament so together

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.700
the anther and the filament make up the

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.080
male part which is the stamen now if we

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.860
want to talk about the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.060
no structure of the flower female

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.509
structure is a little bit more

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.900
complicated the entire structure is

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:40.750
called the carpel sometimes you will see

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:44.000
it called the pistil so those words are

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.430
interchangeable with one another and it

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.949
has three parts at the very top it has

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.099
what's called the stigma and this is

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:56.389
where pollen will actually attach so if

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:58.969
this fire were to self pollinate pollen

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:03.949
from the anther would get stuck on top

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:07.969
of the stigma the stigma is held up by

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:11.389
the style so just like the anther gets

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:14.180
held up by the filament the stigma gets

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:17.090
held up by the style and pollen will

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.190
actually eventually make its way down so

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.990
once pollen actually lands on the stigma

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.689
there will a pollen tube will form and

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.020
the sperm and the pollen will actually

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:29.060
travel down this tube until they get to

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.539
the micropyle which is just like in the

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.139
gymnosperms is an opening by which the

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:39.440
pollen and sperm can actually get to the

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:42.020
eggs and so all that happens in the

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.360
style and then the final part of the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:51.020
carpel or the pistol is what we call the

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:52.490
ovary and this is analogous to good to

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.569
point out it's analogous and not

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.819
homologous it's analogous to the ovary

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:03.979
of mammals it's actually the part of the

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:07.490
flower that produces the eggs so to do a

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:08.990
very quick recap of this whole thing we

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.089
have the receptacle which is what the

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.849
flower actually sits on we have the

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:16.669
sepal which is the green parts that kind

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:18.770
of contain the flower while it's

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:21.919
developing and until it buds and it

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.969
splits open we have the petals which are

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.229
the colored parts that we're all

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:28.129
familiar with that attract the

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:31.219
pollinators have nice bright colors we

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:33.469
have the male part of the plant which is

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:35.330
the stamen and it is made up of the

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.819
anther and the filament the anther is

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.060
what produces pollen the filament kind

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:40.790
of

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:44.480
holds the anthers up and then we have

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:47.419
the female part of the flower which is

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.940
the carpel sometimes called the pistil

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:53.120
and it is made of three parts it is made

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:56.600
up of a stigma which is where the pollen

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.150
actually attaches the stigma sits on top

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.880
of the style and a pollen tube will form

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.310
down that to the micropyle so that the

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.310
sperm can pass and get to the eggs and

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:11.090
those eggs are contained in the ovary

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.970
which is going to be this structure here

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.830
the ovary is actually going to become

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:18.770
the fruit because the second thing that

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.450
angiosperms have the gymnosperms don't

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.120
have is fruit so they have flowers and

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.490
the flower gives rise to actually the

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.360
ovary of the flower gives rise to the

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:31.160
fruit now let's look at the actual

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.330
reproductive cycle of angiosperms and

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.290
see how it's different from that of

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:39.470
gymnosperms as always we are going to

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:42.500
start with fertilization fertilization

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:46.520
is where the egg and sperm come together

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:52.550
and we go from having two haploids to

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:56.419
having one diploid which is always going

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:58.880
to be the zygote so this happens inside

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:01.310
the ovary now we said the ovary is what

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.690
actually is is where the eggs are

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:07.700
produced and that's where fertilization

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:10.639
is going to occur now if we zoom in on

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:14.120
this picture a little bit we'll see a

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:15.590
very interesting thing that most people

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:21.250
are not aware of when they think of

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:23.330
flowers what we can actually see is that

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:26.990
we've got a couple of different things

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.090
going on we have the zygote which is

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.430
something that we're used to having

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:33.680
which is diploid but then we have

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.270
something here that is triploid and this

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.039
is going to be new so this this is a

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:42.080
part of the flower that's actually going

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:43.190
to have three sets of and we'll talk

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.130
about in a minute how that actually

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:49.760
comes about but this is called the

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.970
endosperm and the endosperm is actually

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.250
going to

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:57.030
eventually be a part of the flower that

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:58.560
is going to nourish the growing embryo

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:03.360
and this is going to be something that

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:05.700
is new in flowering plants that we don't

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:10.560
really see in in gymnosperms and so here

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:13.560
if we look up a little bit higher we

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.500
have the endosperm which is triploid and

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.030
then we have the embryo which is diploid

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.650
and we're used to seeing the embryo and

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.540
then of course we have the seed coat

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:25.830
which which we have is it's just like

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:27.210
what we have in gymnosperms the only

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.770
real difference the gymnosperms have a

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.030
seed coat they have the embryo which

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.710
together make the seed but they don't

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.720
have this in dispersion this endosperm

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:37.200
is going to help to nourish it's going

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:40.980
to provide nourishment to the embryo as

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.750
it grows now the seed is going to fall

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:47.240
on fertile ground and it is going to

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:49.860
germinate and it is going to become a

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.390
plant it could be a tree there's lots of

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.340
different you know we have grasses that

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.050
give flowers with trees and shrubs and

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.460
bushes that are flowering plants but the

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.220
ultimate end here is we are going to

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.920
produce the flower and just like we saw

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:04.970
in the last the first part of this video

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.050
the the flower is going to be

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.400
differentiated in its sexual structures

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.340
it's going to have the male part in the

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:15.030
female part so if we focus focus first

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:17.640
on the male part of the plant which is

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.870
the anther there well the part of it is

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.080
the anther and that is what's actually

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:24.510
going to give rise to the pollen very

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.270
similar just like in the gymnosperms the

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:29.070
the anther is gonna have micro sporangia

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:32.910
if you'll recall micro is always gonna

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:36.330
refer to pollen and sperms and mega is

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:39.210
always gonna refer to eggs and ovules

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:45.780
and whatnot so the micro sporangium is

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:49.110
going to by mitosis produce micro spore

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:50.850
Oh sites and remember site means cells

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:54.750
so these are small cells and they are

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:57.900
diploid so again whenever you go from

00:10:54.750 --> 00:11:01.020
diploid to diploid or if you go from

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.920
haploid to haploid that is mitosis that

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.380
is not meiosis

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:08.250
so these micro spore sites get produced

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:14.430
by mitosis and then they are going to by

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:17.160
meiosis give rise to micro spores which

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:21.209
will be hot Boyd so meiosis always goes

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.829
from diploid two haploid these micro

00:11:21.209 --> 00:11:24.930
spores are really going to give rise to

00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:26.730
the male gametophyte which is which is

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:29.850
inside of the pollen tube and that's

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:32.430
very similar to what happens in the

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:35.730
gymnosperms and just like in the

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:42.510
gymnosperms the pollen is going to find

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:43.769
its way to the micropyle of the flower

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.680
and then it's going to actually

00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:48.899
fertilize so by mitosis you will have a

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.240
pollen grain will by mitosis produce

00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:54.660
sperm so you'll be you'll have a haploid

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.940
pollen that is going to produce haploid

00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:00.000
sperm and that's gonna be done by

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:02.579
mitosis and so now let's look at the

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.880
female part of the flower we have the

00:12:02.579 --> 00:12:10.860
ovary which is shown here and inside of

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.019
the ovary it has ovules now if you'll

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.640
recall the gymnosperms do not have

00:12:13.019 --> 00:12:18.959
ovaries they did have ovules

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.620
if you look at the actual cone of the

00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:21.149
gymnast sperm

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:24.209
it has ovules in it but they don't

00:12:21.149 --> 00:12:26.850
actually have ovaries and like we've

00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:31.410
seen before inside the ovary is going to

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:34.709
be megasporangium which out which are

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:39.480
diploid and they are going to give rise

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:41.579
to megaspores and that's going to occur

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.370
by meiosis so we're going from being

00:12:41.579 --> 00:12:46.949
deployed to being haploid so now we have

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.990
these haploid megaspores now only one of

00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:52.170
these mega spores is actually going to

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.790
become the egg the other mega spores

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:57.209
will have different purposes they will

00:12:53.790 --> 00:13:00.149
actually give rise to the endosperm

00:12:57.209 --> 00:13:02.720
which is going to help the egg help

00:13:00.149 --> 00:13:06.870
excuse me healthy to nourish the embryo

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:11.850
as it develops so if we look down here

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:15.540
we have the mega spores which are

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:19.170
haploid and by this time

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:21.300
the sperm have been made by mitosis and

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:24.649
they have traveled down the pollen tube

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:30.000
and they are making their way to the

00:13:24.649 --> 00:13:35.190
micropyle at which point they will

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.139
actually fertilize the egg so here we

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.449
have the sperm they have moved down and

00:13:37.139 --> 00:13:42.750
they are going to come in and they are

00:13:39.449 --> 00:13:44.279
going to fertilize the egg now some of

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.600
these other sperm will actually

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:51.990
fertilize some of these other structures

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:57.540
we have within the obviou we have

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:58.860
antipodal cells and we have synergies it

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.000
would be the combination of the sperm

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.980
and some of these structures that

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.540
actually give rise to the industry the

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:07.589
main thing to remember is that the indus

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:09.649
purpose is to actually assist the embryo

00:14:07.589 --> 00:14:14.100
and survive and give it a little bit of

00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:16.620
nutrients and the entire of you'll

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:20.819
excuse me the entire ovary if we want to

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:22.740
kind of back up a little bit here is the

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:25.649
ovary and so the ovary has several

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:28.139
ovules inside of it is going to develop

00:14:25.649 --> 00:14:30.569
into the fruit so if this were an apple

00:14:28.139 --> 00:14:33.420
tree that would develop into the apple

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:35.040
if it were a peach or a plum tree it

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.870
would develop into the peach or the

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.680
plunge so whatever the actual fruit is

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:42.089
of the plant the ovary is going to

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:46.079
develop into that and it will help

00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:48.300
protect the seeds and also you know by

00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:50.970
being eaten by other organisms it helps

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:55.740
to spread the seeds so let's do a very

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:59.610
quick recap of the life cycle here if we

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:02.100
want to start at fertilization the egg

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:05.670
and sperm come together and that happens

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:09.569
inside an ovule and the ovule itself is

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:12.870
contained inside the ovary the egg of

00:15:09.569 --> 00:15:15.439
course the zygote is is diploid but it

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:17.279
has an end of sperm around it that is

00:15:15.439 --> 00:15:19.410
triploid and that's going to help to

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:22.380
nourish it as it grows and so the actual

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:26.189
seed is going to be composed of the

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.689
embryo which we'll talk about a little

00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:28.980
more later when we talk about monocots

00:15:27.689 --> 00:15:31.230
versus dicots

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.430
it's surrounded by endosperm which is

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.540
triploid and that's going to help

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.190
nourish it and then that is all

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.740
surrounded by seed coat which helps to

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:39.840
protect the embryo is it's finding where

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.790
it needs to to be on land to germinate

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.840
so it's going to germinate eventually

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:46.140
it's going to grow big enough to produce

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.030
flowers the male part of the flower the

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.100
anther is going to have micro sporangium

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:53.160
which by mitosis will give rise to

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.690
microspore sites and those micro spore

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.600
sites by meiosis will give rise

00:15:54.690 --> 00:16:00.420
alternately to pollen and then pollen

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.190
will once it lands on the stigma of the

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:05.700
flower will begin to make the pollen

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:09.600
tube and it will by mitosis produce

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:13.890
sperm and those sperm will travel down

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:16.500
to the ovary to fertilize the eggs and

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:18.300
various structures on the female part we

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.360
have the ovary which is eventually going

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:24.420
to become the fruit of the plant because

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.940
angiosperms are flowers and fruits it

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:29.100
has megasporangium which are going to

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.320
give rise by meiosis to megaspores

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:34.650
and one of those megaspores is going to

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:39.210
become an egg and then the egg will get

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:42.510
fertilized by the sperm and then that

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:45.660
will create the embryo and the process

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.980
will start over now the last thing we

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:52.340
need to do is let's just make a quick

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:54.300
comparison between gymnosperms and

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:57.720
excuse me that's not a gymnast burn

00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:01.140
between angiosperms and gymnosperms so

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:05.820
here's our cycle for angiosperm here's

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:08.940
our cycle for our gymnosperm so some

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:14.990
major differences angiosperms obviously

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:14.990
have flowers and they have fruit

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.329
Jemma's firms do not but gymnosperms

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:23.959
have cones which they use for

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:23.959
reproduction

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:31.710
the primary differences is we have in

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.270
the angiosperms we have the ovary which

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:35.310
is going to give rise to the fruit and

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.680
we also have flowers that have the

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:39.960
different structures and another thing

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.580
is the reproductive structures of the

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.760
angiosperms the male

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:49.190
and the female are together they're both

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:53.130
in the flower whereas in the coniferous

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:56.700
plants the gymnosperms we have a male

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:59.520
cone which is the pollen cone and we

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.510
have a female cone which is the ovulate

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.720
cone so there's another difference

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:05.640
between the two and finally another

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.720
major reproductive difference between

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.340
angiosperms and gymnosperms is because

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.890
angiosperms have this flower they can

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:18.270
use pollinators to move their pollen

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:22.430
from the anther to the stigma of the

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:26.730
carpel and that's how they can pollinate

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:29.310
the gymnosperms have pollen that is

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.570
winged so if we actually zoomed in on

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.650
this a little bit you can kind of see

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:36.810
there's little wings on the pollen of

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:41.060
the gymnosperms and that's because they

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:41.060
are going to pollinate by wind
