[Music]

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.910
ferns come in all shapes and sizes and

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.189
right here in Tazi we've got plenty of

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.410
them I'm in the Tasmanian fernery just

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.710
over from the patch and today I'm going

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.510
to show you how to look after your fern

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.340
starting with the golden rule pick a

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:39.030
species that's right for the climate

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:40.950
that you live in the majority of ferns

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.230
are found in the tropics but the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.629
examples we have here have evolved in

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.140
our cool temperate climate so they're

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.770
well set up for the tasmanian winters

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.110
[Music]

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.330
just as important as choosing the right

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.730
species is choosing the right spot in

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.860
the garden to plant them most firms

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.040
don't like harsh afternoon Sun and

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.990
strong winds some are okay with it but

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.860
if you want that traditional green look

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.810
you've got to plant them in the shade

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.810
[Music]

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.600
this is a fishbone water fern and it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.790
will tolerate some Sun as long as

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.920
there's a bit of protection and plenty

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.600
of water around just having ferns in

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.660
your garden isn't really enough

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.729
you want them to absolutely thrive be

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.610
the envy of your neighbors when you were

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.220
gardener of the Year award maybe either

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.540
way providing the correct nutrients is

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.030
vital for your ferns just before their

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.790
active growth period apply a light top

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.130
dressing and flooding vine and then in

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.830
the warmer months during their active

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.220
growth give them a liquid feed of 1/2

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.590
mix of seaweed and fish emulsion ferns

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.440
can be quite sensitive and organic

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.530
fertilizers are critical just knock back

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.470
your mix by half to a third

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.840
concentration burns are shallow rooted

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.090
so mulch is important to keep their

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.760
roots cooler in the summer and a bit

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.850
warmer in the winter use a chunky mulch

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.110
like this one and reapply fresh mulch

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.350
every spring cut off any old

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.410
sick-looking

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.840
or dead fronds if the plant is being fed

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.959
through the growth period and take them

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.690
back about 15 centimetres from the base

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.510
the old stubs that are left on the trunk

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.250
are a good indicator by managing your

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.890
old fronds you're actually hoping to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.320
manage pests like thrip that if they

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.450
take hold will distort the fronds as

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:50.940
they unfurl ferns don't just have to

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.820
grow in the ground this kangaroo foot

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.989
fern here is going quite happily on this

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.720
deck so near here

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.830
many species are epiphytes so they'll

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.350
grow on tree branches and rocks hand

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.959
watering and drip systems are the best

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.910
approach to watering ferns a lot of

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.190
people say you should only feed and

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.019
water your ferns from the center it

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.480
doesn't really matter as long as you're

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.420
getting water and nutrient in there in

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.700
fact these are rhizomes so by watering

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.060
the trunk you're watering the exposed

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.060
roots

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.130
burns can be quite happy inside too as

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.630
long as it's not too hot or too sunny

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.790
bathrooms can be a great place to put

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.040
them in over the winter and it's a good

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.070
idea to regularly spray over the top of

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.530
them with water I like to put them in a

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.780
saucer in a bit of rock or pebble and

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.370
then fill that with water and that

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.020
creates a good bit of humidity around

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.960
the plant without running the roots

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.010
[Music]

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.410
none of these techniques are

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.110
particularly hard so get out there and

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.270
get cracking and give your ferns a care

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.610
package to keep them happy and healthy

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:18.279
wherever they are inside or out
