WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
hi everybody I just wanted to say that

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.879
this is going to be the last time that I

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.400
put my face here in this little corner

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.700
because I've been doing it without it

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.130
for my other class and my load times are

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.599
so much faster so just to make

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.180
everything easier right here at the end

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.710
I'm going to stop recording my face but

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.980
we can have zoom sessions and you can

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.580
see me and I can see you so here we go

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.199
into the gymnosperms whenever we

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.090
consider the evolution of a new group of

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.300
plants it's important to consider the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.649
world that they're evolving within our

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.920
bryophytes were the first plants to move

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.329
onto land most likely and they would

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.129
have had this completely open

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.140
terrestrial surface which would have

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.450
been high exposure for them which is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.309
tricky right that as stress that they

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.690
are going to have to adapt to but they

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.239
don't have to compete with any other

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.559
plants the seed free vascular plants

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.690
have to compete with the existing

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.850
bryophytes for space and for sunlight

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.530
however those existing bryophytes would

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.350
have already formed some sort of soil

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.030
base at least an organic layer that's

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.189
going to be water holding and then they

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.290
transport that water up to these higher

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.689
areal tissues with their lignified

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.760
vascular tissue and then they can grow a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.369
hundred feet tall and we get forests of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.470
seed free vascular plants so when the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.840
gymnosperms evolved there were a lot of

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.210
large changes happening within the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.710
global environment so for sea free

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.110
vascular plants in that Carboniferous

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.470
period and even in the Devonian we would

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.829
have had these kind of inland seas that

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.720
were pretty shallow and pretty swampy

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.240
most of the continental mass I think was

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.439
in the equatorial range so it was more

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.110
tropical overall but then we have these

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.369
new groups of plants that are evolving

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.770
right when you have the sea tree

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.720
vascular plants we're getting this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.520
accumulation of woody tissue we have now

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.180
true roots that are penetrating down

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.380
into the soils so a lot of stuff is

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.409
happening another thing that's happening

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.810
is that insects are Co evolving with

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.840
these group of Puppets groups of plants

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.600
so insects evolved over 400 million

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.190
years ago around the same time as we

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.780
start seacrest real plants we start to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.879
see terrestrial insects they evolved

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.860
from crustaceans that were aquatic so

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.270
they are Co evolving with these

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.090
from groups of plants and the first

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.500
winged insects roughly coincide with our

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.570
first gymnosperms so we think about

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.790
large events that were affecting the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.640
climate and affecting the overall kind

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.990
of physical structure of the earth

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.720
around the time of terrestrial plants

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.970
first evolving we had global cooling and

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.580
that first soil building that first

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.900
would have been chemical where we have

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.410
metabolic acids being produced by these

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.320
organisms that are interacting with the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.000
rocky surface right and then we get

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.850
physical weathering once we start to

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.620
develop roots those roots that develop

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.250
which happens when we get lignified

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.870
vascular tissue are going to be changing

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.780
the way that water flows around the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.220
planet so they're gonna stabilize

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.050
riverbanks and alter the course and

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.239
structure of waterways and that's gonna

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.400
allow waterways to kind of carve deeper

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.440
as opposed to kind of being more

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.660
expansive and spreading out across the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.459
surface so that means there's going to

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.770
be high water available water

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.880
availability in some areas and lower

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.890
water water availability in others ooh

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.080
so then we also start to see woody

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.850
debris from all of these sea free

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.880
vascular plants that have tons of this

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.110
lignified vascular tissue that

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.519
potentially organisms don't know how to

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.489
break down yet they haven't maybe

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.260
evolved the ability to deal with lignin

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.209
so that woody debris is clogging

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.340
waterways it's altering the course of

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.250
rivers we're also starting to see soil

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.560
enrichment so this building of soils

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.390
from the bottom with the rocky parent

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.739
material and from the top with these

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.000
deposits of organic matter and this is

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.790
the world in which the gymnosperms

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.130
evolved so that we're gymnosperm means

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.380
naked seed so we have one big

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.510
evolutionary leap we get seeds those are

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.489
the first seed plants but those seeds

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.680
aren't contained within any kind of

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.320
vessel for at least most of the groups

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.299
so we have seeds and we can send our

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.040
offspring out with a bunch of extra

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.280
nutrition so that hopefully they'll have

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.750
a better chance of survival

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.160
so in these few videos we're going to

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.870
look at some additions to the big

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.000
phylogeny and what that will be are

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.410
these characteristics of gymnosperms so

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.790
what new traits do we see that are

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.660
uniting these newly evolved seed plants

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.130
under those characteristics of

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.050
gymnosperms we'll look at zero fitted

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.640
leafs will draw a cross-section of a

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.110
pine needle and review those

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.170
characteristics that we learned in the

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.900
leaf lab that allowed these leaves to be

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.720
highly adapted to dry conditions number

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.370
zero means dry then we'll look at

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.440
gymnosperm diversity we have four major

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.080
groups of gymnosperms the gnetophytes

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.540
aren't really the gnetophyta anymore

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.760
they belong within the conifers most

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:06.880
likely so some characteristics of

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:12.730
gymnosperms gymnosperms have secondary

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.860
growth so this means they have true

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.200
woody tissues right instead of just

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.450
having woody tissues that allow you to

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:26.950
make these water pipes and grow tall now

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:33.400
they allow for we have wood rod with

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:39.940
wood and that allows for this increase

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:42.430
in the girth of the trunk right so

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.650
instead of just growing up which primary

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.919
growth allows you to do now our trunks

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.810
can get wider so that provides more

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.290
structural support for getting even

00:05:49.810 --> 00:06:00.480
taller in addition to secondary growth

00:05:53.290 --> 00:06:03.360
our would eat issues we have pollen as

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.399
dispersal

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.830
so up until this point we had spores for

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:10.989
dispersal for our bryophytes and for our

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.059
seed free vascular plants they would

00:06:10.989 --> 00:06:15.309
have their propagules that they were

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:19.629
releasing be those spores so now we have

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:25.419
pollen and pollen is the male

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:35.319
gametophyte this is also called the

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:39.479
micro gametophyte so now we have aerial

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:39.479
dispersal of this micro gametophyte

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.410
because we are now sending our micro

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.110
gametophyte out into the world we have

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:59.570
made it smaller so now we have a four

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.570
celled micro gametophyte

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:27.139
and what what this corresponds to is a

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:30.320
loss of antheridia so before we had

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:32.900
these multicellular gamete an Jia now we

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:36.310
only have multicellular gamete an Geum

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.750
for the female gametophyte so the

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.669
archegonia still exists but we have lost

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.940
antheridia now we just have this four

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:50.210
celled micro gametophyte the next big

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:53.350
evolution we have our seeds so think of

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:56.650
a seed as before we are mass producing

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:59.660
spores right as we send those out to go

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:01.430
grow into gametophyte and then those

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.530
gametophyte s' have to then produce our

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.220
gametes which they I need to go fuse so

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:09.560
we didn't really send those out with

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:13.250
much of a chance for survival instead we

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:16.099
relied on just high production with

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:18.800
seeds you might be producing fewer

00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:20.360
propagules but what you're going to do

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:25.490
is you're going to put a bunch of

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:29.270
nutrients and storage into that seed to

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:32.300
then say okay I've made a zygote I did

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:34.880
it I can reproduce now but I want this

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:37.310
thing to be able to survive once it gets

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.560
there so these seeds are like sending

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:42.380
your kids out with a sack lunch right

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:46.450
giving it the more of a chance to

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.450
survive once it gets out into the world

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.820
so now we have this stored nutrients and

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:16.000
protective coating for our sides and

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:22.930
then specific to gymnosperms we're going

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.460
to c0 fitted leaves and this corresponds

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.980
to the conditions that they're adapting

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.560
to the world is drying out water is

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.090
being increasingly channeled into

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.980
specific waterways instead of having

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.840
these large inland seas the continents

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:38.770
are moving around mountains are forming

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:41.440
and overall the land masses are drying

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.030
out so we have to have adaptations for

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.620
dealing with that harsh environment

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.320
which would be these xerophytic leaves

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:51.610
as well as the bark that we're going to

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.870
have with our secondary growth all right

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.150
here's a review ooh

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:57.970
header ah Spurs this was something that

00:09:55.150 --> 00:10:00.640
I left off so heteros Burruss we have a

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:02.650
mega spores and those mega spores are

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.530
retained so we saw hetero Spurs

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:07.660
condition in Salah janela and that was

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.550
the first time we saw it and then it

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.320
disappeared so it just sort of evolved

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:14.740
within Sailaja nila and then it

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:17.110
convergently evolved within all of the

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.030
gymnosperms and angiosperms so all of

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.140
our seed plants are going to have

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.420
megaspores

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:27.070
and microspores and those mega spores

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:28.780
are going to be retained let's put all

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:31.140
these characteristics onto the big

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.140
phylogeny

00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:49.519
we'll put our ferns and horsetails here

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:52.839
we would have had mega fills leaves with

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:55.910
branching vascular tissue and the

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:58.550
conifer lineage is not the kind of

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:01.279
relating into the gymnosperm lineage is

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:03.529
a little tricky so it's monophyletic

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:07.490
they all derive from a single ancestor

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:09.320
but who comes out first and how these

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.910
groups are related is still under

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.570
investigation so we are using

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:17.630
information from the 1kb

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:23.390
so a thousand plant transcriptomes and

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:27.920
they have the ginkgos as coming out

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:32.120
first then the cycads and I'm drawing

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:37.940
this somewhat incorrectly here we have

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:41.510
the fan opps a toe so these are the

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:43.250
conifers and within the pin-up Sita we

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:45.680
have the Nita bites most likely

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:50.930
according to this particular research

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:53.270
we're using so this indicates that these

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:58.100
two are separate groups the way that

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:59.779
I've drawn it but this is within this so

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.510
just know that but it makes it too

00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:04.970
confusing looking if I try to draw it a

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:10.190
different way okay so let's add our

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:16.510
traits to our main line we have seeds we

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:16.510
have pollen we have secondary growth

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:47.620
would we have heteros Buress with the

00:12:36.459 --> 00:12:53.300
megaspore retained and we have a loss of

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:58.760
antheridia so all of these traits

00:12:53.300 --> 00:13:05.060
continue on into our next group so you

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:08.540
could even fill this in here kantha FATA

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:14.180
those are our angiosperms and that'll be

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:15.740
our last group so they're all on the

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:21.800
main line I'm going to put zero FIDIC

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:23.449
leaves here because we don't know what

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.920
the earliest angiosperms look like they

00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:27.680
might have had zero fitta cleaves they

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.870
might not all of our gymnosperms that we

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.279
look at do have zero FIDIC leaves and so

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:34.250
that's a trait that we can put to unite

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:35.600
this group and everything after it but

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.250
I'm not going to put it on the main line

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.870
because that's not really going to be a

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:42.140
trait that helps us distinguish our

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:44.480
angiosperms one thing that's also maybe

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.940
kind of important is that wood has

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.589
potentially likely evolved many

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.839
different times and how secondary growth

00:13:48.589 --> 00:13:53.630
occurs so it's possible that this

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:57.100
doesn't really belong here but for

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:57.100
simplicity we will keep it there
