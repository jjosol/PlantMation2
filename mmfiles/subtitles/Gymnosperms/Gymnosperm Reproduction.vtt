WEBVTT

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:09.690
we're going to be looking now at the

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.370
life cycle of the first seed vascular

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.980
plants that we're going to look at which

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.439
are the gymnosperms and the example

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.680
we'll be looking at will be the pines so

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:27.140
your gymnosperms are typically just best

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.090
represented as conifers cone-bearing

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.920
plants and they are non flowering so

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.020
they have no flowers but they are

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.399
vascular and they do not reproduce with

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.500
spores like the other plants we've

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.170
looked at the fern and the moss man they

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.510
are going to reproduce with seeds so if

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.110
we're going to look at the an overview

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.379
of the lifecycle the reproductive cycle

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.340
of these guys one thing that we need to

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.239
look at first though is the difference

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.850
in their actual cones so here is

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.400
actually a photograph of a real pine

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.159
tree and what we need to notice is that

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.470
they have two different reproductive

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.090
structures here the cone that you're

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.540
probably most familiar with is the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:25.229
actual female cone the ovulate cone

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:30.600
which is going to produce the eggs and

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.130
then we have the male cones which are

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:40.380
going to give rise to pollen which will

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:44.670
eventually give rise to sperm now we can

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:49.009
go back to the actual life cycle here it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.439
is and as usual we want to start with

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.540
fertilization just down here at the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.390
bottom and that's where the sperm and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.229
egg are going to come together and make

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.759
the embryo so let's zoom in on this a

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.039
little bit and here is our embryo which

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.390
is going to be the new sporophyte which

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.650
of course is diploid so fertilization is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.190
always going to be taken

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.920
haploids and making a diploid and the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.930
embryo together with the seed coat are

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.420
going to develop into the seed and then

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.099
the seed a lot of times seeds will have

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.909
little wing like structures which are

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:36.440
going to help them blow in the wind and

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:39.090
become dispersed which will help them to

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.579
get to a suitable environment to be able

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.290
to germinate and grow so once the seed

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.109
falls to the ground and begins to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.040
germinate it begins to grow it is going

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:56.160
to produce a seedling as we see right

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:58.230
here and that is going to grow into the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.780
mature sporophyte which is going to be

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.450
the the actual pine tree they're used to

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.409
see and then that pine tree is as it

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.720
gets larger and reaches a an age and a

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.810
size where it can reproduce sexually it

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.120
will produce an ovulate cone of mini

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.239
ovulate cones and and many pollen cones

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.239
and ovulate cones or we can think of as

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.419
the female part of the tree and the

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:29.220
pollen cones we can think of as the male

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:30.930
part of the tree and they are going to

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.889
obviously the other that's eventually

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.629
going to give rise to eggs and the

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:41.940
pollen cone is eventually going to give

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:44.699
rise to sperm now let's start by

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.109
focusing on the ovulate cone inside the

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.030
cone if you could actually cut through

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:52.379
this cone in a cross-section you will

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.629
see that it has lots of ovules those

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:59.400
scales that you typically see on the

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:01.709
pinecone each one of those as a novel in

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.569
it and anytime you see of you need to be

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.629
thinking of eggs for example in mammals

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.459
we talked about ovulation which is

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.959
actually when an egg goes from the ovary

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.919
is released from there and getting ready

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:21.150
to be fertilized so obvious and the

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.849
female reproductive structures so if we

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.830
kind of zoom in on the ovulate cone or

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.320
excuse me on the ovule of the ovulate

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.340
cone

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.570
we will see that it has what's called a

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.460
megasporangium

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.910
which is kind of this whole structure

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:40.500
right here and inside of that is going

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.260
to be a mega spore aside which is

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:49.390
diploid and it's like a obviously site

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.710
the suffix side means cell so and then

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.090
whenever you see mega you need to be

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.860
thinking about eggs we're going to talk

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.000
about sperm in a minute and that will be

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.070
micro but eggs are always much larger

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.770
than sperm so the megaspore site is kind

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.130
of this original cell that's going to

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.980
eventually give rise to eggs you also

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.260
this ovule has an intimate kind of a

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.710
skin around it that protects it and it

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.860
has a micro pile which is a hole where

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:21.000
the pollen will actually attach so that

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.000
fertilization can occur

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:30.970
now the megaspore site is going to by

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:36.180
meiosis remember meiosis always takes us

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:40.210
from diploid two haploid by meiosis is

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.200
going to produce megaspores and one of

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.950
those megaspores

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.380
is going to become an egg eventually

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.960
eventually give rise to the egg now if

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:55.390
we want to back up a little bit and we

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:57.880
want to look at the male cone the pollen

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.750
cone a similar thing is going to happen

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.410
in the female structure we had

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:07.990
megasporangium which gave rise to

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:10.840
megaspore sites and those megaspore

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.530
sites eventually gave rise to mega

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.630
spores which are haploid we have a

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.830
similar thing going on here in the

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:23.980
pollen cone we are going to have

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.700
megasporangium which excuse me micro

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:30.370
sporangia which are a lot like the

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.400
megasporangium of the female part of the

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:36.490
cone and they are going to give rise to

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:39.830
diploid microspore sites and again

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:42.390
that's going to be by mitosis

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.940
remember mitosis is always going to go

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.470
from well not always but usually it

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.240
always do something identical so if we

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.430
start with something diploid we're going

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.020
to end with something diploid sometimes

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.880
as we'll find out in a minute

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.740
we will start with something haploid but

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.750
we will end with something haploid so

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.060
mitosis is always going to produce

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.220
something like itself so these micro

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.220
sporangia mitosis are going to produce

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.570
microspore o sites and then those micro

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.330
spore Oh sites are going to be tiny

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:13.320
cells inside the microsporangia they are

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:18.390
going to by meiosis produce pollen

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:21.300
grains so meiosis is going to be it's

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.920
going to go from diploid - haploid and

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.930
we're going to have each of these pollen

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.960
grains is going to be differentiated

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.400
from the other because of the

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:33.120
recombination of DNA that happens in

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.980
meiosis eventually one of these pollen

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:39.780
grains is going to find its way to the

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:41.370
micropyle of the ovule to begin

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.320
fertilization and now one thing we have

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:47.550
to remember is gymnosperms have no

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:53.840
flowers so what that means is that they

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:55.980
are going to reproduce by wind um

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.410
flowering plants will attract

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.280
pollinators to carry pollen from one

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.820
place to the other

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:05.040
but gymnosperms don't have flowers they

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.810
are going to just rely on windblown

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.850
pollen and eventually some of that

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:11.970
pollen is going to make its way to a

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:13.940
micropile Manavi owl and begin the

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:20.520
process of fertilization

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:23.520
now the megasporangium gave rise to the

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:28.650
megaspore aside and that by meiosis gave

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:35.849
rise to megaspores and so these mega

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:41.490
spores are what are actually going to

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:42.840
eventually give rise to the female part

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.670
of the plant the archegonium the archa

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.870
Ghonim is going to be greatly reduced in

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:53.220
gymnosperms and so the megaspore by

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:53.640
mitosis now the megaspore is haploid but

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.470
remember

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.430
by mitosis it's going to produce another

00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:02.760
haploid structure the archegonium and

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:05.990
the archegonium is going to again by

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:09.780
mitosis it's going to produce the eggs

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:12.000
so recap that the megaspore is going to

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:18.120
produce the archegonium which is going

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.550
to produce the egg inside the ovule now

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.230
all of this time the pollen is what we

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:25.950
call it's germinating in other words it

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:28.830
is going through it has cells inside of

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.120
it that are going through mitosis the

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:35.780
the pollen we could think of it the

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:39.600
pollen as being the male gametophyte and

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:42.150
we could think of the archegonium here

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:48.180
which came from the megaspore as being

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:52.140
the female gametophyte and the pollen is

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:56.180
going to produce sperm and those sperm

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:59.970
are actually going to make their way

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:02.940
toward the egg so there's actually in in

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:06.210
this particular life cycle here there's

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:09.210
there's two eggs that get produced by

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:11.630
this arch ago neom so here's why well

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.380
let's see let's assume in a little bit

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:17.610
get all fuzzy

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:19.830
so the archegonium is given rise to two

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:22.770
eggs and the pollen is actually going to

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:29.610
produce sperm that will fertilize those

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:31.500
eggs now a pollen tube is going to form

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.060
and basically from the micropyle which

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.890
again is the opening here where the

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.560
pollen landed in the first place it's

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.610
kind of pollen tube is going to form

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:42.240
various enzymes and things are going to

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:45.600
help that to occur and the sperm is

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.940
going to go in and fertilize the eggs

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.490
and so at that point we'll be back here

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:52.650
at fertilization that will produce an

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:56.210
embryo which will develop the embryo

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:58.770
with the the collective structures here

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:00.840
will develop into the seed and

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:04.710
eventually into the seedling and into

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:07.089
the entire tree so just to do a very

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:09.879
quick recap of the gymnosperm

00:11:07.089 --> 00:11:12.579
life cycle fertilization is going to

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:16.709
occur and that's going to produce seeds

00:11:12.579 --> 00:11:19.449
and the seeds are going to produce the

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:22.089
dominant sporophyte which is the actual

00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:25.180
tree the tree will have an ovule a cone

00:11:22.089 --> 00:11:29.139
which is the female part it will have a

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:33.610
pollen cone which is the which is the

00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:38.559
male part of the tree

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:41.069
the ovulate cone will have ovules in it

00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:44.050
and those ovules will have a

00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:47.259
megasporangium which by mitosis will

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:49.209
produce megaspore sites and in the

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:52.749
megaspores sites let's see that happens

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:57.300
by mitosis the megaspore asides then by

00:11:52.749 --> 00:11:59.589
meiosis will produce mega spores and the

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:02.589
megaspores will give rise to the

00:11:59.589 --> 00:12:04.959
archegonium which will give rise to the

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:08.439
eggs and those of course all that

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:12.910
happens by mitosis so up here where our

00:12:08.439 --> 00:12:15.189
mitosis goes from diploid two diploid

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:18.249
down here it goes from haploid two

00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:23.620
haploid mitosis is always like producing

00:12:18.249 --> 00:12:27.370
light in the pollen cone which is the

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:30.100
male part of the tree similar things

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:34.420
happen you have micro sporangium which

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:37.240
are similar to the megasporangium of the

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.970
female part and the micros perineum by

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:44.679
mitosis give rise to the microspore

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:47.290
sites and those by meiosis give rise to

00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:49.509
pollen grains the pollen grains are

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.490
going to land in the micropyle which is

00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:53.350
the opening in the ovule

00:12:51.490 --> 00:13:00.189
so that fertilization can eventually

00:12:53.350 --> 00:13:01.540
occur the egg the eggs that were

00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:05.230
produced by the archegonium are

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:07.720
eventually going to be fertilized by

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:11.589
sperm produced by the pollen so once the

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:14.100
pollen remember the pollen is haploid

00:13:11.589 --> 00:13:16.480
because it was produced by meiosis

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:19.350
so it's haploid it was produced by

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.350
meiosis and

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:29.589
it is then going to by mitosis produce

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:31.629
sperm which will be haploid and those

00:13:29.589 --> 00:13:36.549
haploid sperm will fertilize the eggs

00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:38.139
and then the eggs that the zygote will

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:40.420
form and that will eventually go into an

00:13:38.139 --> 00:13:44.549
embryo which will give rise to the tree

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.549
and it all starts over again
