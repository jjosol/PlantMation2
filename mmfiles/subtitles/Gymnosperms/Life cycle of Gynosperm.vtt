00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.140
welcome back to our video series on

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.160
plant diversity and evolution in this

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.440
video we're going to look at the

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.290
reproduction seed plants gymnosperms and

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.509
angiosperms we're going to use the pine

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.880
tree as our poster child for all tuna

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.430
sperms and basically any flowering plant

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.010
to represent the angiosperms remembering

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.109
that in the gymnosperms or in the pines

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.050
at least the reproductive structures are

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.140
cones and in the angiosperms they're

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.449
flowers now I may turn this into a

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.590
two-part video depending how long it

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.000
takes me to get through the gymnosperms

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.730
but let's start there so the life cycle

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.469
of the gymnosperms

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.420
look at the pine trees we have the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.250
reproductive structures the cones but

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.739
there's two types of cones there are the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.570
female cones or the seed cones sometimes

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.399
called the woody cones that what you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.190
think about when you kind of visualize a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.010
pinecone but we also have male cones or

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.780
pollen cones they're smaller and spongy

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.600
or in texture and obviously they're the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.070
ones that can relate the pollen let's

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.739
look at the male side of things first

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.360
here's a pollen cone remembering that

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.689
this is the sporophyte generation that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.119
we're seeing the diploid generation and

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.159
sporophytes make spores so let's zoom in

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.060
on part of this pollen cone this

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.950
sporophyte is going to make spores and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.250
since the sporophyte is diploid and the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.170
spores haploid we need meiosis now

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.810
specifically since we're going to make

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.060
the microspore remembering that seed

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.369
plants are heterosporous we have a micro

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.950
score and a mega spore and so in the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.530
pollen cone through meiosis we make the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.430
Micra spore now we know that spores

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.350
become gametophyte and the Micra spores

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.140
specifically becomes the male

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.049
gametophyte and if we remember in seed

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.909
plants the milk and meet a fight is

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.659
pause video write down what I'm about to

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.930
say pollen that's right the male

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.549
gametophyte and seed plants is pollen

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.219
this represents the gametophyte

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.869
generation at least on the male side

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.270
let's move over to the female side and

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.030
look at the woody cones or the seed

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.009
cones and if we zoom in on a section of

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.079
this one of these scales and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.579
we zoom into one of those we see a novel

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:20.819
and again this is the sporophyte

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:23.819
generation so inside the ovule is a cell

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.620
called the megaspore mother cell now if

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.840
it's a mother cell it means it's going

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.239
to give birth to some other cell and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.030
it's the cell that's going to make the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.329
megaspore so it's diploid it's the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.370
sporophyte generation we're going to

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.680
need me osis to make it haploid so

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.440
inside the ovule megaspore mother cell

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.769
undergoes meiosis making four haploid

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.109
cells now only one of these is going to

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.030
become the megaspore these are the three

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.290
kind of go away they're not important

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.579
now

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:00.030
this megaspore is the haploid spore and

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:02.250
we know the spores become gametophyte so

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.549
it's going to grow by mitosis to become

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.859
the female gametophyte so this and I've

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.480
blown it up a little bigger here inside

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.849
this female gametophyte or a number of

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.069
cells one of which is the egg because it

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.379
give me the fight's make gametes and the

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.120
other is the endosperm mother cell which

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.069
is going to give rise to the endosperm

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.599
now we're going to talk more about the

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.230
endosperm but it is the nutritive tissue

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.340
that's going to sustain the embryo after

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.569
fertilization but we don't have it yet

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.389
we just have the cell that's going to

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.750
give rise to it so the pollen co-maid

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:37.169
pollen and in the seed code on the seed

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.709
cone we've set up everything to make a

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.349
seed

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.049
we just need pollination to occur so

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.299
here we have our female give me a fight

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.430
mate holding our egg in our innocent

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.099
mother cell and we just need pollen in

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.199
the pine-trees pollen it is brought by

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.000
the wind it's wind born it's not brought

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.819
by a pollinator like we might see in

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.250
flowers no no insects involved here so

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.620
the wind blows pollen over here and when

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.060
the pollen reaches the scale of the cone

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.769
it discharges the sperm the sperms going

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.889
to fuse with the egg and fertilize the

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.780
egg and make the zygote the endosperm

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.530
mother cell divides producing the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.019
endosperm

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.909
now the zygote is diploid it's the

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.039
result of fertilization the endosperm

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:21.040
the nutritive tissue around the zygote

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:26.150
is happy

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:30.289
now the zygote will become the embryo

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.990
and surrounded by the endosperm the

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:37.610
nutritive tissue and we are formed the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.580
seed now the seed if we go back to the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.070
seed cone the seeds are found here when

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.289
the Coons mature the scales peel back

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.560
like they see in this picture and the

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:51.350
seeds can fall out of the cone land on

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.389
the ground and grow into a new pine tree

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.610
and that's going to do it for the life

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.380
cycle the gymnosperm now I'm going to

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.940
make the angiosperm life cycle and

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.800
reproduction its own video it takes a

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.419
little longer so come back for that one

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.930
if you have any questions about this one

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:09.190
leave me comments below the video and I

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.190
hope you learn something
