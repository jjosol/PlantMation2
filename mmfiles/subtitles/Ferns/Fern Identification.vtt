00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
hi everyone its Emily bringing you

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.160
another micro class this week I thought

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.830
it'd be fun to focus on ferns

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.259
I'll admit that before I started working

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.770
at grass River which as you know is a

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.199
very in the nature Natural Area that's

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.920
very heavy on the wetland ecosystems I

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.869
did not know a lot about ferns but since

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.519
then I've become pretty excited about

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:33.090
them they're neat because they are ferns

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.680
as a group are 400 million years old to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.200
put that in perspective the dinosaurs

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.469
went extinct 65 million years ago so

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.210
they're super old as a group of plants

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:45.210
and they used to be the dominant plant

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.820
type in our forests after or before they

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.090
got out competed by gymnosperms which

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.280
are like cone-bearing plants like pines

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.610
and spruces and then angiosperms which

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.690
are flowering plants um but they're

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.960
super neat in that they do not have

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.240
seats they reproduce by spores or

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.000
vegetatively and the spores are often

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.110
clustered on the underside of the leaves

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.049
in little stacks called sporangium and

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.119
then those sacks are clustered on sorai

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.159
under the leaves which are visible to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.140
the naked eye and those none of them are

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.369
really reproducing quite yet since it's

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.280
so early in the season but you'll be

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:33.030
able to see that later on as the season

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.250
progresses and let's see I guess one

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.810
thing I should mention early on is that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.020
one of the easiest ways to identify

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.240
ferns is based on how many times they're

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.759
divided or how many times the fronds are

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.920
cut so I'm going to show you guys an

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.439
example of what I mean by that so here

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.500
we have a Bracken fern and this is cut

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.770
three times or we call it being sliced

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.670
divided three times divided so this is

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.930
one frond right here one frond and that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.200
is cut once

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.450
twice and then I don't know if you can

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.090
see these tiny little leaflets are also

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.670
divided they're also compound so cut

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.040
once twice three times and that's a

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.740
really easy way to start separating out

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.660
groups of ferns that will go a long way

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.150
towards identification but also for

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.490
Bracken ferns we should talk about that

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.470
they are very tall in general you can

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.410
see this one very tall they'll get to

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:35.380
about waist height in the summer and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:38.890
there the fronds are often divided in

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.989
three so we have this triangular frond

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.850
this triangular blade and then this

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.670
triangular blade right here so three

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.340
blades that are all triangle-shaped and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.410
there isn't another type of fern that's

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.760
this tall that has those three

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.110
triangular blades and breadth and fern

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.510
is probably the most common friend we

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.280
have here in Michigan it loves to grow

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.470
in open areas and it likes full Sun

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.269
which is not what we typically think of

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.250
as a fern characteristic and it love it

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.530
can grow in poor soils - so like along

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.350
roadsides as well as in openings and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.269
clearings

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.750
alright so here we are on the fern trail

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.870
very aptly named and I mentioned in the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.640
earlier section that ferns reproduce by

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.269
spores but they can also reproduce

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.400
vegetatively meaning by rhizomes which

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.100
creep under the ground and then pop up a

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.049
new fern right there so those that means

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.940
that those ferns are all clones of the

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:46.600
parent fern and that causes a lot of

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.610
ferns to grow in dense patches or

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.980
colonies which is what we're seeing here

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.840
with the sensitive fern it's growing

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.579
kind of in a little patch right here in

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.750
sensitive ferns like to reproduce raised

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:01.959
ominously and it's called sensitive fern

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.930
because it's very sensitive to frost and

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.610
to drought at the first early frost and

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:12.430
fall it just dies back it's very

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.920
sensitive and it's unique unlike most

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.239
other ferns in

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:21.090
it's only once divided so you can see

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.019
here's a frond and then it's just cut

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.310
once

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.250
right there and then the it has very

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.450
wavy margins but they're not divided so

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:37.470
just once divided and it's a very light

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:40.050
bright green sort of color and it's

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.220
important for wildlife because the

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.250
Fertile fronds

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.500
so this fern actually has different

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.419
fronds different types of fronds

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.340
it has vegetative fronds so the leaves

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:54.950
like this and then it'll have fertile

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:58.400
fronds which have the spores on them and

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:01.260
those persist through the winter time

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.970
and they stick up out of the snow really

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.240
common sight to see in the winter and

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.530
wild turkeys and other wildlife really

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.180
love to eat them in the winter it's a

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.930
very important source of food for them

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:19.140
and those lean times yeah so that

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:22.890
sensitive fern okay here we have one of

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.050
my favorite ferns it's tiny it's so

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.700
diminutive and it really won't grow much

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.580
more than this it never really gets

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.850
higher than about nine inches this is

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:36.960
the oak fern and it looks like a mini

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:40.320
Bracken fern in that the frond is

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:46.470
divided into three triangular blades

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:48.600
it's very bright yellow green and you

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.060
can see that the blades are very

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.979
strongly horizontal they're almost

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.930
parallel to the ground there have been a

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.390
very horizontal plane that's very

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:02.880
characteristic of our little tiny oak

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:06.150
fern okay so here we have cinnamon fern

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.700
and it is Jim is starting to unfurl from

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.260
its fiddlehead that's what all ferns are

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.419
called when they're still rolled up like

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.360
this and you can see that the

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:21.419
fiddleheads are very furry it's like a

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:25.159
whitish rusty Brown sort of fur and it

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:28.249
also is fuzzy down

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:29.989
the stems down here on the Stipe and

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:32.989
that's a characteristic of sensitive

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:35.149
cinnamon fern it will retain all this

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:39.800
fuzz throughout the whole growing season

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:42.409
on the on the Stipe and also on the

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:47.569
under side of where the leaflets meet

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:50.979
the stem and you can see I just picked

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:57.319
this up this is um a stem from last year

00:06:50.979 --> 00:07:00.919
that it's very fuzzy right here very

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:04.219
fuzzy and also it's called cinnamon fern

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:06.800
because for this for this reason because

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:08.839
the this fur is kind of cinnamon colored

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:14.139
but also the Fertile frond

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:16.490
so like sensitive fern cinnamon fern has

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:18.259
fraud a fertile from that looks very

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.509
different than its vegetative fronds

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:24.349
so the Fertile frond grows up from the

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:25.969
middle of the clump cuz cinnamon Fern

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:27.889
Grows in a clump like this almost like a

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:30.199
vase shape the Fertile frond will grow

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:34.339
up from the center and it will be tipped

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:36.559
with a very cinnamon colored I guess

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:38.839
that's where the spores are so cinnamon

00:07:36.559 --> 00:07:42.769
colored spores in the in the surah in

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:46.369
the sporangia and if you want a great

00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:48.349
example of a cinnamon fern eye right now

00:07:46.369 --> 00:07:51.829
and right near the bench on the new

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:54.079
boardwalk just east of trail post 18 and

00:07:51.829 --> 00:07:56.709
there are two fantastic examples of

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:59.119
cinnamon ferns right here and when these

00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:03.649
fiddleheads unfurl the leaves will be

00:07:59.119 --> 00:08:05.809
twice divided so cut two times all right

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:08.149
that's all I have for you guys today I

00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:10.669
hope I inspired you to fall in love with

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:15.199
ferns like I have they're so delicate

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:17.149
and lush and beautiful and I should

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:18.589
mention that these are not the only

00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:21.829
ferns we have that grass River we have

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:24.139
lots more like maidenhair fern and wood

00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:27.349
burns and Marshburn Xibalba ferns and

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:29.240
New York ferns and royal ferns and lots

00:08:27.349 --> 00:08:30.919
more so this is a great place to come

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.529
check out your ferns if you feel so

00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:35.539
inclined thanks for joining me on this

00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:38.949
grass river micro class and

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.949
I will see you guys next week bye
