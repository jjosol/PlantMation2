Today’s topic is the exciting process of
plant reproduction in angiosperms. But before

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.630
we get into that, we want to tell you a little
story that completely relates---and always

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.930
reminds us of how fascinating plant reproduction
really is.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.210
Now we are sisters that live in different
areas of Texas, with our own separate families.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.390
One day, in the Pinky household, I happened
to notice a few bees flying by our window.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.930
I happen to be pretty enthralled by most insects
so my family watched these bees for a while.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.379
It didn’t take long to realize that these
bees had made a nest---a beehive so to speak---in

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.550
the insulation material in our house. They
had found a small opening through the window

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.820
sill. Some people may not enjoy this, we realize- but we were a little fascinated. It’s not every

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.070
day that you can observe a beehive so close.
But over the weeks, we found a lot of friends

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.010
suddenly started having some weird plans and
things that came up that always seemed to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.610
keep them from being able to visit our house.
One day, we had a little family barbecue and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.240
learned a very scientific lesson.
(Not really).

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.260
Bees do not like barbeque!

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.120
Or maybe they don’t like the smoke from
the grill, we're not really sure. And maybe it was

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.170
just that our particular bees had a distaste
for barbecue---we have not done a controlled

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.790
study on this. But on this day, it became
apparent to us that the bees had to go. But

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.130
we didn’t want to call an exterminator.
Why? Well that’s where we get into this

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.759
amazing story of plant reproduction. We’ll
come back to this story in just a minute and

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.659
how it ties into plant reproduction.
Angiosperms are flowering plants, and they

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.159
are some of the most successful and diverse plants around.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.219
When you think of flowering plants, you may
not realize that a lot of plants actually

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.119
produce flowers. Many grasses for example.
Many crops. All plants that produce fruit.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.280
In fact, flowering plants all bear fruit---just
maybe not the type of fruit you are thinking of.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.520
Not all fruit ---if going by the
biological definition---are sweet or even edible.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.259
By the biological definition, a fruit develops
from the ovary of a plant. Which doesn’t

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.710
exactly sound appetizing.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.920
Pumpkins, green
beans, tomatoes, squash---these

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.209
all developed from the ovary of a flowering
plant. These are all fruits.

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.459
The term “vegetable” really isn’t

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.340
used as a true biology definition. A lot of
what grocery stores classify to be vegetables

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.580
are other structures of plants----like leaves (think
of lettuce) or stems (think of celery).

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.840
And sometimes grocery stores just classify vegetables as plant structures that are generally not as sweet.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.120
So angiosperms have flowers and these are the reproductive structures. Many flowers

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.670
contain both male and female parts. Other flowers only contain one part.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.050
Let’s talk about flower parts of an angiosperm.
First, we’ll start with male parts. The

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.980
male parts make up the stamen. Stamen has
“men” in it so that helps me remember

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.010
male. The stamen includes the filament and
the anther. The filament is a stalk that supports

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.440
the anther---the anther is a rather fluffy
structure that produces pollen.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.480
Now on to female parts. The pistil. The pistil is made of three major parts. The stigma---I

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.600
like to say “sticky stigma” because pollen
is supposed to stick onto this sticky structure.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.220
The style, which is the stalk that supports
the stigma. And then the ovary at the base of

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.200
this structure. The ovary is where fertilization will occur inside and seeds are formed within it.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.360
Also remember that the ovary will ripen into a fruit. There are some parts of the flower that are

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.440
neither male nor female. Sepals for example.
Sepals protect a developing flower bud. Or

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.560
petals for example. Fancy structures that
help attract pollinators. Which will take

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.280
us to my bee story and also the steps of angiosperm
(aka flowering plants) reproduction.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:49.640
First, let’s understand a pollinator. Pollinators can include many types of organisms. Hummingbirds, butterflies, and bees are all examples.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:57.680
While pollen contains amino acids that some pollinators may feed on, and bees do certainly use the pollen as a food source (especially for their young),

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.480
another great attracting factor for many pollinators is nectar.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:11.920
Nectar is a sugary sweet substance produced by many flowering plants and it is a great source of carbohydrates- meaning a great source of energy!

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.400
As a pollinator drinks

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.800
some of the sweet nectar, they tend to brush against the anthers of a flower. Remember that anthers produce

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.280
pollen. Have you ever gotten a really good
look at a bee? Many times you will see a yellow

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.120
dust---pollen---all over their bodies. They
just can’t help themselves…

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.160
The idea is if this pollen can be brushed
from a pollinator onto the sticky stigma, the flower

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.160
can be what we consider pollinated. But it’s
not done yet. Pollination is not enough. The

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.840
sperm cell must join an egg to be fertilized. And if it's just sitting there on the stigma, it hasn't gotten there yet.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.240
Just a disclaimer, we are going to

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.280
simplify this amazingly complex process of fertilization in angiosperms.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.520
But understand the main function is that this process is going to help the plant develop seeds.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.400
Which can then grow into new baby plants.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.920
First, you have to understand that pollen grains- well mature ones anyway- consist of two types of cells.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.560
A tube cell and a generative cell.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.600
So basically this pollen grain, once landing on the sticky stigma

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.760
uses the tube cell to burrow down a pollen tube from the stigma through the style

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:28.120
to the inside area of the ovary. The generative cell will divide to form two sperm cells.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.680
So, what do these two sperm cells want to do?

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.640
Well, they are actually going to target an ovule, which is inside the ovary.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.320
There can be multiple ovules inside a plant ovary.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.120
But each ovule has the potential to develop into a seed if fertilized.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.600
Now the ovules have two major key players to mention.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.240
An egg cell and something else called two polar nuclei, which I'll get to in a second.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.880
One of the sperm cells fertilizes the egg.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.520
This forms a zygote

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.800
which is basically a fertilized egg. The  second sperm cell joins
with the two polar nuclei.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.160
The function of combining with these two polar nuclei is that this will develop into the endosperm. The

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.360
endosperm is full of nutrients for a developing
baby plant.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.440
Now if you are wondering, how did the egg cell develop and where did the polar nuclei come from?

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.560
I highly encourage doing a little research! It's a process we need another video clip to cover.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:27.400
Because the fertilization process involves sperm cells joining two different
things (the egg and the polar nuclei)---we

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:34.040
call this double fertilization. Double fertilization is an important event in angiosperms.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.920
Angiosperms also have an added benefit that the surrounding ovary will ripen and develop into a fruit

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.040
(remember: not necessarily an 
edible fruit) that can help seeds travel far from the parent plant.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.080
You don't want baby plants to have to compete with their parent plant.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.520
For the nonedible fruits, some have the ability to stick to animal fur or be carried by wind or water.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.080
For the edible fruits, when an animal eats them, the seeds may pass through
the digestive system unharmed but in this

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.280
way, they can travel a great distance from the parent
plant.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.440
One thing to point out that we didn’t mention
in our example--- many species of angiosperms

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.360
are picky and will only accept pollen from
other plants and not accept pollen from their

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.960
own anthers. (Basically not allowing self
pollination). Which would make the travel

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.760
of pollinators even more important. For crops
all over the world----what would we do without

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:35.840
our pollinators? Wind and other methods can only take you so far. Because pollinators are so important, we found a beekeeper who happily

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.880
relocated our bees and took them off to a
bee farm where they could happily pollinate

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.720
flowers and let us barbecue at our house in
peace.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.920
Well that's it for The Amoeba Sisters, and we remind you to stay curious!
