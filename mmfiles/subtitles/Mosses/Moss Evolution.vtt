00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.720
[Music]

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.760
most people who go into the forest

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:31.840
enjoy trees and only few see

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.840
the mosses

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.890
[Music]

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.280
but in fact we have about 120 000

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.160
different species and about 1600

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.440
in europe of mosses alone because they

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.840
are tiny plants you

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.600
have to look very careful to see the

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.480
difference

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.920
and if you look close enough you will

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.720
notice that the moss

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.119
plants are a very little forest and this

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.880
is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.439
one of their functions in nature as well

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.760
they are tiny forests for even

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.439
tinier animals like insects or bacteria

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.119
living in them so they are part of

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.159
today's ecosystem

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.880
and the soil where the trees are rooting

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.080
in

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.840
is over the million of years accumulated

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.840
debris of plants

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.280
but if you go back in time for 500

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.240
million years

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.960
all this would disappear no trees no

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.840
soil

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.840
only bare rock

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.320
so the first plants developed from green

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.799
algae from fresh water

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.840
and they had to cope with very harsh

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.960
environments

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.520
they had to develop novel innovations

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.960
a lot of genes which encode for

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.040
protective agents

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.000
which could protect these first plants

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.000
these mosses

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.840
from harsh stress like cold ice

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.840
heat uvb light

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.840
and with this capacity they really could

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.800
transform

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.640
earth to the way we know it so they gave

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.760
the oxygen into the air

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.800
which allowed animals to develop on land

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.680
and ultimately we as humans but they

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.319
persisted

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.920
since about 400 million years we know

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.080
mosses on earth

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.640
and they did not change much in shape

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.120
and nature

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.519
they saw the dinosaurs coming and going

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.280
and they saw us humans coming and if we

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.120
are not careful enough with our planet

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.879
they will see us going but the mosses

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.879
will persist probably

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.120
one of the fascinating characteristics

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.560
of mosses is that they are very adaptive

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.000
to different environments

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.400
and they can withstand drought

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.760
like resurrection plants and if you add

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.080
a bit of water

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.550
then they gloom up again they live up

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.669
again

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.669
[Music]

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.440
they are pioneer plants in the city as

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.280
well

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.440
and they get their nutrients from the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.120
air and therefore they are able to

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.159
filter air as well

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.959
so they can take pollutants from the air

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:32.959
and use them for their own bioenergy

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:35.840
so one major step for biotechnologists

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.720
is to take a specific mosque from this

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.680
environment

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.000
very tiny faction bring it into the lab

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.319
and

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.560
establish a so-called lab culture so

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.720
without any contaminating other species

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.360
no bacteria no fungi

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.239
to analyze and utilize this specific

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.480
moss

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.840
and so you don't have to disturb anymore

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.239
the environment

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.080
you only take up a very tiny fraction

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.519
and then you make a propagation in the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.840
lab of the pure moss

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.840
species

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.040
each moss has its peculiar needs

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:19.120
for temperature for nutrition

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.720
for ph and so this is a very difficult

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.680
task to transfer

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.400
a specific moss type more species from

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.680
nature

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.080
so it looks easy but it takes a lot of

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.080
efforts

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.360
personally i started very early so i

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.080
spent all my scientific life

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.000
working on mosses the moss fiscametria

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.560
patents was the most i started

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
with and which is now considered to be a

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.759
flagship model organism so we sequenced

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.360
in an international effort the whole

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.560
genome and in fact it was

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.600
the third plant genome ever sequenced

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.639
to total and what we discovered is for

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.520
example

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.919
that this specific moss has about 12 000

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.880
more

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.840
protein coding genes than humans have

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.320
one of the questions

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.199
of course when we discovered that fiscal

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.039
metrella and

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.960
in fact other mosses as well have so

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.360
many protein-coding genes

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.400
was what are they good for because

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.720
mosses don't have

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.080
roots they don't have flowers they don't

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.400
produce seeds

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.280
and what we find analyzing these genes

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.160
is

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.120
that they produce much more ingredients

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.000
bioactive

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.200
substances than for example flowering

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.680
plants

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.360
[Music]

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.560
one class of these special ingredients

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.680
mosses have

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.919
are polyunsaturated fatty acids and they

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.320
are

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.479
important for example for the human diet

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.600
but they are important for the moss

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.560
to cope with extreme environments so

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.800
they make

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.120
membranes smooth and flexible

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.759
[Music]

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.479
in winter for example you see that all

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.120
the plants

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.759
lose their leaves or they get brown but

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.639
mosses

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.479
still under eyes are green and making

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.720
photosynthesis and in fact

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:11.919
some years ago colleagues of mine from

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.600
canada found

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.360
living moss about 2 000 years covered by

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.440
ice by a glacier

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.520
and they were able to retrieve this moss

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.280
bring it to the lab and regrow it there

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:34.000
so it was still alive after

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:35.759
2000 years buried under ice

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.240
have the world's largest collections for

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.360
example for peat mosses called swagnum

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.759
mosses

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.639
and sphagnum mosses are very important

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.720
for nature

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.080
or for our whole planet because

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.120
peatlands store

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.199
double the amount of carbon then all

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.000
forests combined on earth so they are

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:57.280
important carbon storages

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.120
and they are very important for moisture

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.720
so they have specialized tissues the

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.720
mosses we see

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.800
for example protonema in the youth

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.960
stadium which is growing for example

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.680
here in the bioreactor which resembles

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.120
green algae in fresh water

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.919
and the most plant on this protonema has

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.240
stems and leaves and making erect growth

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.479
and

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.680
coping with photosynthesis and with the

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.759
sun

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.960
and each of these different stadiums

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:25.919
have different

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.479
chemical design in it for the specific

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:28.960
needs

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:30.080
and muscles are very resistant because

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.960
they have

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.840
more and specific ingredients with help

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.570
them to communicate with the environment

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.800
and to protect them from attack

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:44.160
[Music]

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.120
so a lot of medicine humans use but even

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.080
cosmetics

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.120
humans use depend on plant substances

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.240
and so far

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.840
still very few laboratories worldwide

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.280
work on mosses and we still

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.800
knew only a very tiny fraction of the

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.520
biodiversity of the different mosses

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.080
we have so many different moss species

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.800
in so many different parts of the world

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.639
so there's a lot of space and room to

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.520
discover to explore

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:12.400
even the biochemical diversity so we are

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:27.840
really

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:27.840
only at the beginning

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.519
you
