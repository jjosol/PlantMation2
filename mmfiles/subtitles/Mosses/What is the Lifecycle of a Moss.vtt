2
00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.040
what is the lifecycle of the moss long

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.170
long years ago a special group of plants

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.910
with a sense of adventure began making

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.260
the journey from water to land what were

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.060
these plants moss there are thousands of

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.910
known species of mosses but the question

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.550
is what plant group does Moss belong to

9
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.899
bryophytes include the various mosses

10
00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.940
and live rods that are found commonly

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.860
growing in moist shaded areas in the

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.910
hills bryophytes also called amphibians

13
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.590
of the plant kingdom because these

14
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.059
plants can live on soil but are

15
00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.860
dependent on water for sexual

16
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.280
reproduction the plant body of Rio finds

17
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.390
is more differentiated and that of algae

18
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.940
it is talus like and prostrate or erect

19
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.890
and attached to the substratum by

20
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.699
unicellular or multicellular rhizoids

21
00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.589
they lack true roots stems or leaves

22
00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.110
however they may possess root like leaf

23
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.490
like or stem like structures mosses are

24
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.350
small flowerless plants that typically

25
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.810
grow in dense green clumps or mats often

26
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.900
in damp or shady locations let's learn

27
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.680
more about moss and its lifecycle the

28
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.880
predominant stage of the life cycle of

29
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.500
the moss is the gametophyte which

30
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.439
consists of two stages

31
00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.270
number one pro to nama and number two

32
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.869
leafy stage the first stage is the

33
00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.640
proton Emma stage which develops

34
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.979
directly from a spore it is a creeping

35
00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.659
green branched and frequently

36
00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.180
filamentous stage the second stage is

37
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.130
the leafy stage which develops from the

38
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.149
secondary proton Emma as a lateral bud

39
00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.070
they consist of uprights Landa axis

40
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.369
bearing spirally arranged leaves they

41
00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.320
attach to the soil through multicellular

42
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.990
and branched rhizoids this stage bears

43
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.050
the sex organs

44
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.020
the sex organs are multicellular the

45
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.390
male sex organ is cold and 3dm they

46
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.960
produced a flagellate and tara Zoids the

47
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.540
female sex organ called archegonium is

48
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.000
flask shaped and produces a single egg

49
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.520
the Antero swords are released into the

50
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.220
water where they come in contact with

51
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.650
archegonium the entero soit fuses with

52
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.290
the egg to produce the Zygons i gods do

53
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.670
not undergo reduction division

54
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.040
immediately they produce a multicellular

55
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.120
body called sporophyte the sporophyte is

56
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.070
not free living but is attached to the

57
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.350
photosynthetic gametophyte and derives

58
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.510
nourishment from it some cells of the

59
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.220
sporophyte and the goal reduction

60
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.380
division or meiosis to produce haploid

61
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.260
spores these spores germinate to produce

62
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.120
gametophyte let's solve some important

63
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.740
questions from medical exams question 1

64
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.340
gametophyte 'ok stage is dominant in

65
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.460
number 1 bryophyte ER number 2 Teredo

66
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.350
fighter number 3 gymnosperm or number 4

67
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.120
angiosperm this question was asked in

68
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.770
Punjabi MT 2010 solution the main plant

69
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.320
body of the bryophyte is haploid it

70
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.480
produces gametes hence is called

71
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.660
gametophyte

72
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.890
hence option 1 is correct

73
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.960
question tooth in bryophytes and

74
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.560
thyroids are number one with flagellate

75
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.740
number two uni flagellate number three

76
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.230
some time by flagellates and sometimes

77
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.960
UNIF legislates this question was asked

78
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.640
in CPM tea 2012 solution in mosses

79
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.860
antheridium is male sex organ which

80
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.110
produces the flagellate male gametes

81
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.670
cold and thyroid hence option 1 is

82
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.580
correct this video concludes about the

83
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.560
life cycle of the mas students must

84
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.090
remember the two stages of the life

85
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.330
cycle to answer question in the exam
