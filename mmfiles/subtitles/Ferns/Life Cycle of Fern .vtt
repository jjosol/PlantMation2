00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:06.240
life cycle of fern

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.800
the plant body of fern is divided into

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.960
root stem and leaves

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.000
leaves are the only aerial part of plant

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.160
body

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.680
stem is represented by underground

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.039
rhizome rhizome is densely clothed with

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.560
numerous scales or ramenta

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:29.039
leaves are large compound and look like

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.679
a branch hence named as frond

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.200
each leaf has a short stock called

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.239
petiole

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.200
the penny develop on main stock called

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.879
ratchets which is the continuous of

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.840
petiole

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.239
leaflet with sporangia are known as

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.600
sporophiles

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.399
sporangium bears large number of spores

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.039
the sporangia are aggregated in groups

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.039
called sorry

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.040
the spore is minute dark brown and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.040
tetrahedral in shape

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.200
the prophallis is green and heart-shaped

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.560
the prothalis lies flat on the ground

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.600
and bears many unicellular rhizoids

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.119
on the under surface anthoradia and

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.119
archigonia are born

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.079
and therazoids swim in water by their

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.079
cilia

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.160
one of the sperm fuses with the egg to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.959
form a zygote

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.040
it covers itself with the cell wall and

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.040
is called usbor

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.400
the uspor divides and redivides to form

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.200
the embryo however with the development

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.800
of green leaf and root and with the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.959
decay of prothalis sporophyte develops

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.959
into an independent plant body
