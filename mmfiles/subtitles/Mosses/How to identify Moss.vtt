00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.750
what's going on everyone Tanner here and

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.359
spring is in full effect we're in the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.090
mid 60's to lower 70s right now which

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.950
means I can finally finally get outside

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.840
that's right I'm out here I'm feeling

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.360
good I feel like myself again no more

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.980
seasonal affect disorder not only am i

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.810
free but they're free as well they've

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.730
been locked up all winter just ready to

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.550
roam free that's not what you came here

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:30.989
for today is this kind of video

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.989
[Music]

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.490
that's right this one is gonna be all

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.680
about moss

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.120
more specifically collecting it I got to

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.590
get some from various projects that I'm

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.060
working on right now so I wanted to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.100
bring you guys along for the ride and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.600
show you some tips and tricks let's get

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.910
right into it when you're looking from

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.280
Austin look no further than your own

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.320
yard where my garden right now and as we

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.610
were planning things the past weekend I

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.379
noticed that there was a lot of nice

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.629
moss in here so let me show you what we

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.160
got down here some of the losses that I

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.200
was telling you about and we have a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.440
variety down here I believe it's mostly

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.729
star moss and thread moss now before we

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.619
get into that I know a lot of you guys

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.479
are curious about how I identify my

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.580
mosses and that's something I will get

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.470
through as we go further into the video

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.840
but in the meantime this is some thread

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.780
moss and star moss so let's take a few

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:27.109
patches here

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:27.109
[Music]

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.020
so I'm just filling up this compartment

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.060
of my trusty container here with mosses

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.350
from my garden but before we finalize

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.210
that I just wanted to show you this

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.280
little scene here I have a composer

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.600
using the rule of thirds but this is the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.730
kind of stuff that I reference whenever

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.590
I'm doing my setups and I just thought

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.340
it was a really cool scene and wanted to

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.340
share it with you guys

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.659
now underneath of my deck can we have

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.640
some really choice badge moss under here

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.229
but as you can see somebody's already

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.759
been taking it for themselves so I don't

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.619
know who it was but somebody's been

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.670
doing it and they had the right idea so

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.950
we're gonna take some of it for

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.950
ourselves exist stuff is a really choice

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.580
now I know that many of you are gonna be

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.500
able to find moss in your yard but the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.540
best place to look really is out here in

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.739
the woods now to be honest right now

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.140
there's probably actually a better

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.849
selection in my yard and that's largely

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.160
because we're pretty early in spring

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.560
there's not any foliage on the trees yet

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.239
so the forest floor and everything it's

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.100
drying up quicker than it typically

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.260
would so are the mosses that are

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.540
available here are dried out but that's

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.769
not necessarily a bad thing down here

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.239
you can get a better look what I was

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.920
telling you about as you can see the

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.260
moss is really dried up and it just

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.730
peels up really easily now that's nice

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.620
because we're not getting any of the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.330
dirt or other stuff that sticks to it

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.040
and since it's dried out it's actually

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.049
gonna acclimate really well to your

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.540
setup because right now it's still kind

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.459
of dormant it thinks it's winter or it's

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.170
not sure quite yet what it wants to do

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.609
but when we put it in our setup it's

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.440
gonna think hey it's spring it's summer

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.329
and then it's just gonna grow like mad

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.250
so it's actually not a bad thing to get

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.640
a piece that's kind of dormant and dried

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.380
out like this we're about 20 feet from

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.299
where we just were and this is actually

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.250
a perfect example of the opposite of

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.959
what we just saw this area is a little

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.850
bit more shaded by the logs and

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.100
everything here and this is just like a

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.959
rotten stump full of moisture so it's

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.090
actually gonna retain moisture for the

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.310
moss to feed off of and it's thriving

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.720
whereas that other stuff looks like it's

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.000
all dried out and both are completely

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.040
alive it's just that this stuff kind of

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.230
has a head start on the moss that you

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.239
just saw now if you want a harvest moss

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.459
that's growing on wood it's best to

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.470
actually take some of the wood that it's

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.480
growing on even if it's just a thin

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.760
layer because this is what the moss is

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.010
accustomed to growing on for ever reason

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.660
it seems to like whenever you keep a

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.430
portion of the wood with it and then

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.200
they can gradually work up to whatever

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.060
type of setup you have them in so if

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.950
it's a substrate if it's on another

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.840
piece of wood any sort of growing

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.880
surface they're gonna acclimate to that

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.709
quicker because they already are growing

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.690
on what they're used to and then they

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.740
can kind of branch out from there so to

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.030
speak or spread out to their noon

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.500
and they should do quite well here's a

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.390
location that has all of the right

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.580
conditions year round meaning that the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.230
moss typically never goes dormant it's

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.030
always out and about and in this

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.430
location it's actually a lot wetter than

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.410
some of the places we saw previously so

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.000
much so that it's almost like a bog and

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.040
in this spot there's a lot of live

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.170
reward and sphagnum Moss there's other

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.970
types of mosses too but predominantly

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.680
sphagnum Moss and you're really not

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.230
going to see that in other locations

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.860
it's typically in bog conditions or

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.970
really wet areas now it will grow in

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.370
terrariums and whatnot that are not

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.810
quite as what is this but whenever

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.160
you're looking for it out in the wild

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.050
you're only going to find it in spots

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.700
like this so I definitely came for some

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:58.470
of this

00:04:48.700 --> 00:05:01.090
[Music]

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.890
if you're in a location that's plentiful

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.930
with moss and there's also a lot of leaf

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.520
litter around it's worth moving the leaf

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.770
litter to see if there's anything under

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.170
it it's often time to find some hidden

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.000
gems underneath of there as you can see

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.370
if I move all these leaves there's just

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.800
a ton of liverwort underneath of here

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.630
now live reward isn't a moss but it

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.670
grows in pretty much the same conditions

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.590
typically preferring areas like this

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.390
where it's really moist but I wanted to

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.490
take some of this and talk about it in

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.710
this video just because like I said it

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.730
grows in similar conditions and pretty

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.320
much if you're gonna be able to grow

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:36.910
moss you're gonna be able to grow it

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.080
forward about ten feet from where we

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.900
just were there's a pretty substantial

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.540
patch of mixed mosses and here we have

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.400
some hypno moss and some star mosses and

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.740
this is a perfect place to show you

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.750
bought my moss code what I like to do is

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.760
whenever I take away from patches of

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.590
moss like this I'll only take what I

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.150
need maybe like a little section like

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.670
this I'm not gonna take this entire

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.200
sheet of Moss and deplete it from the

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.420
forest because what if I want to come

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.480
back to the same spot and I want this

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.370
Moss again or if by chance somebody else

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.260
is collecting Moss back here I highly

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.540
doubt it but if they were they could

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.920
take from this patch as well or even I

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.500
don't want to take away from the beauty

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.240
of nature here so I take what I need and

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.520
for example if I were to take from the

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.060
middle of the patch like this I'll often

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.350
sort of work it back in like that and

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.540
it's almost like nothing that ever

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.270
happened but I don't want this patch so

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.730
I'm gonna put it back and let it do its

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.960
thing I get a lot of comments from

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.430
people who say that I should have

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.840
brought a shovel with me or something

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.420
like that I guess they don't like

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.130
getting dirt on their hands while protip

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.480
keep your nails short you're not going

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.430
to get dirt under there and you don't

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.020
need to wear gloves but that aside

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.310
whatever you're collecting Moss you

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.840
don't need to be digging it up or

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.080
anything like that just get your hand

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.550
and kind of peel it up like that real

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.070
simple you don't need to be digging

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.110
anything up there just touch the surface

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.840
of the ground and should peel out pretty

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.000
pretty easily here's another area that's

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.130
pretty wet we have some hypno moss here

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.830
and it's growing on a rotten log which

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.320
of course is saturated with water this

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.330
again will be one where we have to take

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.050
whatever it's growing on it looks like a

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.330
little bit of

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.910
or even some of the rotten tree just

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.379
attached there and again this is looking

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.569
pretty good because it's in an area

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:21.370
that's nice and wet I definitely think

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:23.379
that I collected enough mosses from back

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.789
here for now there's one thing that I

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:26.229
want you to take away from this though

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:27.729
before you get going and that is

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:30.340
whenever you're out in the woods looking

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:32.020
for moss find the areas of moisture for

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.150
the best mosses of course you're gonna

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.620
see them everywhere but if you find that

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.599
stuff that's growing in your areas that

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.190
are already wet those are what's gonna

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:41.800
do best in your terrarium they're gonna

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.870
acclimate the quickest and there will be

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.580
less lag time so to speak

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.830
pretty much all mosses will work in

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.389
terrariums long term but those ones

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.860
especially there will be pretty much

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:52.680
another acclamation they'll just start

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.180
growing like crazy

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.190
we're back in the animal room I got the

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.680
studio set up we've got all of our

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.449
spoils here before we open these up and

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.949
take a look at the mosses I just want to

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:05.199
make a quick mention of the container

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:07.030
itself obviously it's nice because it

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:09.460
has a divider and I can separate the

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:11.050
mosses based on type but it's also nice

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.759
because I don't actually have to use

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.560
these right away I'd say you've got

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:16.000
about two or three days before you got

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.319
to get the mosses out of here

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.509
since they're sealed up they're actually

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:21.789
gonna retain a lot of the water that's

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:23.590
in the mosses themselves and keep them

00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:25.300
hydrated so they're not gonna dry out

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.130
you can see on the side here there's a

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.650
little bit of condensation and that's a

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.990
perfect sign of that as I put the mosses

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:34.450
out on this piece of coroplast here I'm

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.010
gonna separate them based on type so

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.539
they can give you some pointers on how

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.539
to identify whatever you have

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:45.220
[Music]

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:47.589
and here we are a beautiful spread of

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.730
mosses there's quite a variety here and

00:08:47.589 --> 00:08:51.279
if you don't think that's something nice

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:53.050
to look at I don't know what is I know

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:54.699
early on in the video I said I was gonna

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.279
give you a lot of information on how to

00:08:54.699 --> 00:08:59.350
identify mosses for yourself now I kind

00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:00.880
of retract that statement because as I

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.380
tried to film it for this video I

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.149
realized that I didn't want to just

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.250
shove it into a short little segment

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:08.529
because it's a really in-depth topic so

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:10.750
I'd rather save it for a dedicated video

00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:12.339
so do it at some point in the future but

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.410
anyways let's look at the mosses that

00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:16.420
we've collected here let's start out on

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.579
the right with some thread moss now this

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.260
is a really common moss and I say common

00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:22.449
because I'm sure you've seen it before

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.250
if you've ever been in an urban setting

00:09:22.449 --> 00:09:25.570
and you've seen moss growing in between

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.550
cracks of the pavement

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.380
I'm almost guarantee that it's this Moss

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.510
right here I don't know what it is about

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.610
this one as opposed to the others but

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.959
this one is always in settings like that

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.760
and the way that you could tell this

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:38.620
Moss apart from the others is that it's

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.839
really fine if you touch it it almost

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:43.690
feels like hair if you turn it to the

00:09:40.839 --> 00:09:46.209
side it looks like individual strings or

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:47.980
threads as the common name implies a

00:09:46.209 --> 00:09:50.139
pretty cool one this one of those really

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.610
well in terrariums and if you put it in

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:53.380
there and let it grow for a few months

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.540
it's literally gonna look like a patch

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.519
of hairs because it grows up about an

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.620
inch tall or so a bunch of little

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:01.899
individual threads it looks really cool

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.060
on to these ones here which may look a

00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:05.709
little odd right now this is some star

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.839
Moss that has a bunch of sporophyte

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:10.089
growing out of it now what sporophyte

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:12.519
are without getting into too much detail

00:10:10.089 --> 00:10:13.060
is basically the mosses equivalent of a

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:15.399
flower

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.930
they each have a bunch of Moss spores in

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:18.910
them they'll get disrupted by the wind

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:20.589
or what have you and then the moss pores

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.329
will get spread and moss will grow

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:24.910
elsewhere the way that you can identify

00:10:22.329 --> 00:10:26.620
star Moss is that if you look at it it

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.209
looks like a bunch of individual stars

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.490
growing close to the ground

00:10:28.209 --> 00:10:31.959
that's stay relatively small I'll show

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.180
you Moss here in a moment that looks

00:10:31.959 --> 00:10:36.310
really similar but it grows much larger

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.199
and taller where it's like I said this

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.589
one stays low to the ground and is

00:10:38.199 --> 00:10:40.389
smaller

00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:42.880
pretty cool Moss same does really well

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:44.949
in terrariums on to the ones that I said

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.380
look like star Moss but or not what we

00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:49.269
have here is some hair cap Moss as you

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.949
can see it's a good bit taller and a

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:51.670
decent amount larger than what you saw

00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:52.500
previously

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.600
there's also

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.040
Brown sporophyte growing out of this one

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.290
so that could be an indicator as well

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.480
but these ones do fairly well in

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.010
terrariums for the most part I would say

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.750
though that if you're looking at hair

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.970
cap Moss be sure that you're getting one

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.380
like this that is completely green if

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.870
you get the ones that are about two

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.460
inches tall and they're mostly brown the

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.380
whole way up and then green on the top

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.060
they really don't do well in terrariums

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.830
you could definitely experiment with it

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.960
if you wanted to I haven't had success

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.300
with them but I'd usually do it these

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.670
ones this is a great accent as well

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.440
because it can grow pretty tall has some

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.870
great texture to it and definitely one

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.370
of the ones that I like wait let's back

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.410
that up a little bit I don't know what I

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.690
was saying there I like all mosses

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:36.000
anyways let's take a look at this Magnum

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.520
Moss this one is extremely easily

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.470
identifiable obviously it's much larger

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.020
than the other ones and it's also

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:45.450
engorged with water if you feel it it's

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.670
kind of springy sponge like none of the

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.990
other ones are quite like that as you

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.060
pull it out of the ground it's usually

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.730
not gonna have much attached to it if

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.530
anything and like I said earlier in the

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:58.080
video you're really only gonna find it

00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:00.240
in extremely wet locations like a bog or

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.590
something like that so if you see this

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.810
I'm pretty sure you're gonna know what

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.640
it is the same goes for the next one

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.050
which is some fern moss I mean if you

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.270
look at that close-up it looks like a

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.260
bunch of individual ferns obviously none

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.910
of the other ones have that

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.490
characteristic so you know right away

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.440
this is some fern Moss this one is

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:18.720
pretty cool just obviously because of

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:21.300
how it looks it grows really well under

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.800
variable conditions and something

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.390
interesting about this specimen in

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.190
particular is that whenever we first

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.990
harvested them they were really dried

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:30.270
out but just from sitting in those

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:32.070
containers with other mosses for a day

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.290
or two they already picked up a lot of

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:36.630
that moisture and they look much more

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.700
lives than they did previously moving

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.140
over again we have some hypno moss

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.120
Hittner moss is pretty easily

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.370
identifiable for a few reasons

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.840
one is the color as you can see it's a

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.610
much brighter green than all of these

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.710
other ones here almost like a chartreuse

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.810
color and it typically does look like

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.490
that another reason is the way that it

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.950
looks if you look at it closely it looks

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.480
like a cotton string woven together and

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.490
although there are other mosses that

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.530
look like that this one especially has

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.480
that characteristic which is pretty cool

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.440
this one also has some sporophyte

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.850
growing out of it

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.460
which look much different than the ones

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:10.320
that we saw previously I will say that

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.150
this mas doesn't always do well in

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.220
terrariums I think that it is a hard

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.290
time acclimating to new environments

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.000
that said I have had some success with

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.510
it in the past and it's definitely worth

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.650
trying because it's a pretty common moss

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:24.960
over here we have another Moss that's

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.790
pretty easy to identify if you look at

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.830
it close up it almost looks like a bunch

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:31.440
of individual leaves growing on stems

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:34.110
but don't be confused this is a moss and

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.030
this one is bad Moss it's not really too

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.980
common but it will grow really well on

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.750
terrariums and it will add a lot of cool

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.610
textures so if you can get your hands on

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.380
this one I definitely recommend it

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:46.050
because it's a great one and it always

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.850
seems to do really well last thing we

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.770
have some live reward like I said this

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.660
isn't a moss but it shares a lot of the

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.670
same characteristics you're typically

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.140
gonna find it in the same locations and

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.300
it requires pretty much the same

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.370
conditions to thrive so I figured it was

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.800
worth throwing it into this video for

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:03.180
the most part these are easy to identify

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.370
there are some that look like the badge

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.260
Moss I showed earlier so you may confuse

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.570
the two but for the most part they look

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.910
like this one here almost like kelp or

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.690
seaweed growing low to the ground

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:15.150
occasionally they can have a trident

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:17.580
shape to them this one here doesn't but

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:20.040
again really easy plant to grow works

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.630
really well on terrariums looks awesome

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:28.410
and it's a great addition alongside

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:30.510
these now that I've shown you off the

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.910
moss is I harvested I got to get them in

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.320
a propagation bin here but before I do

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.120
that I want to clean them off a little

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.250
bit and what I have here is just some

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.990
dechlorinated water now I'll typically

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:42.000
reference whatever type of water that

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:44.040
I'm using but dechlorinated is

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.840
especially important for mosses because

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.910
they're pretty sensitive to chlorine and

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.800
chloramines the reason that I like to

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.900
clean my mosses is to get rid of any

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.580
excess debris it will also help hydrate

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:56.370
them a little bit and get them ready for

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:58.020
the life of a terrarium but also to get

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.240
rid of some pests there will be some

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.890
things that sort of hitchhike on here

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.080
and obviously dipping them in water

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:06.870
isn't gonna get rid of everything but it

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.940
will help against noticeable pests and

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:11.370
again all that I'm doing is just dipping

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.440
the mosses in the water clearing them of

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.420
debris getting them nice and hydrated

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.700
and then I'm putting them in my

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.300
propagation bin here and I'm separating

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.740
them by

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.480
type of moss obviously they're pretty

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:24.150
close together but I'm gonna be using

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.950
them in no time so there'll be spots for

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.480
it to grow and everything like that I

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.530
almost forgot to mention that if you

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.540
want to learn more about this

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.640
propagation method that I'm doing right

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.980
here check out the link up here I have a

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.840
whole video dedicated exclusively to

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.640
this so will give you an idea as to

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.980
exactly what I'm doing here

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.020
I also do collect moss in that video but

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:45.600
I didn't go as in-depth as I did in this

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:47.330
video but hopefully the combination of

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.670
these two should give you a pretty good

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:52.470
framework to start with this gives you a

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.570
good idea of everything that I cleaned

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.550
out of the moss obvious a lot of it is

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:58.350
just dirt so it's discoloring the water

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.510
but there is a ton of debris in there

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.190
that really you just don't need it if we

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:04.020
want pristine moss I've gotta clean out

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.210
all this debris and it will grow

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:08.400
perfectly the last thing that I'll do is

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:12.240
spray this down with some dechlorinated

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:16.650
water again dechlorinated water and just

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:20.640
getting it all good to go then after

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:23.160
good spray down we seal it up and it's

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.810
ready to go and that's going to do for

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.310
this one surface squad I hope that you

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.390
guys learned a thing or two that you can

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.400
utilize while you're out in the field

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:31.350
collecting moss if you want to learn

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.060
more about the propagation process that

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.800
I showed in this video I'll leave a link

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.840
down in the video description on a video

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.090
all about it as well as my outdoor

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.830
essentials videos I go a lot of videos

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.420
where I'm outside doing cool things like

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:44.280
this and I definitely think that there

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.990
must watch so if you're downloading you

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.150
want to see some more content definitely

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.860
follow those links lastly I thank you so

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.720
much for watching if you enjoyed the

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.010
video and haven't done so already be

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.630
sure to leave me a thumbs up as it

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.880
really helps me to continue creating

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:58.680
content like this and I look forward to

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:02.690
