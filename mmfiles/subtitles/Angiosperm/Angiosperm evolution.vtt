00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.730
Angiosperms are higher plants.
We are going to look at the changes that occurred

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.610
to make the different groups or kinds of angiosperms
over time.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.890
This really comes down to a couple of little
changes that have occurred over time that

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.759
gave us each individual group.
When we start out, we talk about basal angiosperms.

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:31.259
And these were the ones that lived during
the time of the dinosaurs and we have ideas

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.350
of what they looked like based on fossil evidence.
But when we start dealing with these what

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.670
we find is basal angiosperms really had 2
cotyledons and they had pollen with 1 opening.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.019
This then gave rise to a group which today
is represented by things like the water lily

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.269
were you actually see everything in a spiral
format.

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.140
You can see these very distinctive parts and
these are basically remnants from what happened

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.210
previously.
The group of this is now called the Nymphales.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.461
From there was the formation of ethereal oils.
You got a folded fan-like carpel, so that

00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:15.890
the carpel actually folded around on itself.
But it really didn’t necessarily fuse together

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.720
and make something.
But it folded on it.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.600
And from this we have that group which looks
like this.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.841
You can see the carpels that are folded.
When you look at this particular flower, what

00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:36.660
we are looking at things again are spiraled.
The carpel when you see it actually is folded,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.650
and the seed is on the inside of it.
And when the seed is released, you get an

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.180
unfolding of those carpels.
This shows another one of the same group.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.110
What you see is the same sort of parts.
We group these in the Magnoliids.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.530
And this includes Magnolia and tulip poplar
which at the 2 flowers we have represented

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.160
there.
They have flower parts in 3’s and they are

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.740
spiraled.
We also have another group where it started

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.360
to lose one cotyledon.
So rather than having 2 cotyledons, we now

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.800
only have one cotyledon.
With this we see things like this.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.200
This happens to be a banana.
You can see in this particular thing, we start

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.319
to get parallel leaf veins.
We have the loss of one cotyledon.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.829
This is a picture of oats.
Oats are grasses.

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.980
Again, we have the loss of one cotyledon,
so in this particular case we are looking

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.420
at monocots.
This also has seeds that have one less cotyledon,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.959
so they only have one cotyledon, rather than
the 2 that are normal.

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.920
Here is your banana when it is going to fruit.
And we call these again monocots.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.280
Flower parts are in 3’s, leaf veins are
parallel.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.499
So they are a little bit different from the
magnoliids.

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:55.750
Even though they have flower parts in 3’s,
there is parallel leaf venation.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.989
We don’t tend to get things that are spiral.
Then there was the loss of ethereal oils

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.280
We got plants that had pollen with 3 openings
instead of 1 opening.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.060
Out of this we got a great variety of plants,
that have these characteristics.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.319
We still have 2 cotyledons.
We have pollen with 3 openings, which becomes

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.220
very easy to be able to visualize.
It includes the thistle.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.480
We have a bean plant.
Over here on the bean plant, you can see how

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.799
it has germinated up and the 2 first leaves,
if we want to call them that, are actually

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.400
the cotyledons.
We’ve got, this is a mallow type flower.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.219
Again, it is quite pretty and quite showy
and it fits this particular description.

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.469
These are called dicots.
And again with dicots, we have flower parts

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:51.510
in 4’s and 5’s, and we’ve got 2 cotyledons.
So dicots are very interesting, and they are

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:00.370
a step up above the other groups.
Now these together form the basal groups of

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.599
the angiosperms that we deal with.
And these are the angiosperms that we can

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.239
easily find today.
