00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.960
In the previous tutorial we discussed lycophytes, 
which were the first vascular plants on earth.  

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.440
But these still did not closely resemble 
the modern plants we are most familiar with,  

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.920
like trees. The next type of vascular 
plants to evolve were finally of a  

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.200
more familiar form, and those were ferns.
Ferns are more advanced vascular plants than those  

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.360
we’ve discussed previously, namely because they 
are the first to have true roots and stems. Fern  

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.120
stems bear leaf-like structures called megaphylls, 
which are essentially larger versions of the  

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.000
microphylls grown by lycophytes. The fern group is 
large and incredibly diverse, including a variety  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.160
of ferns and scouring rushes or horsetails. 
Most fern species grow as small or medium-sized  

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.360
herbaceous plants, meaning no woody stems above 
the ground, but larger tree ferns can be up to 25  

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.560
meters tall. The smaller herbaceous ferns can grow 
as epiphytes, which again are plants that grow on  

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.320
other plants, and they can also be epipetric, 
which is a term for plants that grow on rocks.  

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.840
The oldest ferns appeared during the 
Carboniferous period, about 360 million years ago,  

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.480
but most modern fern groups appeared during the 
Cretaceous period, about 145 million years ago. 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.840
In ferns, like lycophytes, the diploid sporophyte 
is the dominant generation, or the generation that  

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.680
we’re most aware of seeing. If you look at the 
back or undersides of the megaphylls on a fern  

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.840
sporophyte, you’ll often see small brown or black 
dots in neat rows. These brown dots are sori,  

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.040
or groups of sporangia where the haploid spores 
are produced through meiosis. Spores are released  

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.560
from the sporangia, where they fall to the 
ground and germinate as new haploid gametophytes.  

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.720
Not much is known about fern gametophytes in the 
wild because they are very small and ephemeral,  

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.000
meaning they don’t live very long. Most of 
what scientists know about fern gametophytes,  

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.160
also known as prothallia, comes from studying them 
in a laboratory setting. The haploid gametophyte  

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.280
attaches to the soil with rhizoids. As with 
the other gametophytes we’ve discussed,  

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.280
a fern gametophyte bears both reproductive 
heads and can self-fertilize. Just as with  

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.920
previous plant groups, antheridial heads 
produce sperm cells through mitosis,  

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.840
and archegonial heads produce 
egg cells, also through mitosis.  

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.000
When there is sufficient water in the environment, 
the sperm cells can swim to the archegonial heads  

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.200
and fertilize the egg cells. Once an egg cell has 
been fertilized, it germinates into a new diploid  

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.080
sporophyte directly from the gametophyte. Once 
the sporophyte is ready, the gametophyte dies off. 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.960
The fern sporophyte generation is readily 
identified by the characteristic “fiddlehead”  

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.680
of its curved stem before the megaphylls unfurl. 
Many people eat fiddleheads, but it’s important  

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.160
to properly identify the fern species first 
because some are poisonous. Once established,  

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.680
many fern sporophytes are perennial, meaning 
they will grow in the same spot year after year  

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.520
without having to alternate with the gametophyte 
generation. Additionally, many fern sporophytes  

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.040
are able to engage in a different form of 
reproduction called vegetative reproduction,  

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.760
which entails propagating new plants via rhizomes 
growing in the soil. This reproductive strategy  

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.160
has caused a few species, like bracken fern, to 
become aggressive weeds in some disturbed areas. 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.720
And with that, we’ve covered both nonvascular 
plants and the simpler vascular plants. Now  

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.240
it’s time to discuss the more complicated and 
more recognizable types of vascular plants,  

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.160
so let’s keep moving forward in 
the evolutionary history of plants.
